I had to tow the vehicle to a Kia dealer where it took 17 days to repair with a new power module.   On [XXX], (after the vehicle was repaired), I was driving the vehicle when the POWER alert flashed on the dashboard.

Full Self-Driving (FSD) was engaged. I had placed an order for a new Model Y on August 2 and took delivery on August 10 (different VIN).  During the demo, FSD initially performed well: it autoparked into an apartment parking spot and exited once correctly. However, the second time, the system made a dangerous maneuver. It activated the left indicator and accelerated rapidly as if entering a roadway, but instead turned left directly into a pole. The pole struck the rear door. I braked, but the system’s sudden move left no time to react. A reasonable human would have exited slowly and cautiously, but FSD acted abruptly and unsafely.  My pregnant wife was in the passenger seat, and both of us were frightened. This incident raised serious concerns about FSD’s ability to handle low-speed, high-precision situations. The car should have detected the pole and stopped, yet it did not. If a child or pedestrian had been nearby, the consequences could have been severe. This also makes me question whether FSD could make dangerous high-speed maneuvers.  At the Tesla showroom, we were told FSD drives “better than a human,” which misled us as new customers. This was the first car I purchased, and I was unfamiliar with FSD’s limits. Only after the incident did I realize how risky it can be. In my new Tesla, although offered a free FSD trial, I have chosen not to use it.  Tesla’s claims administrator, Fleet Response, has since sent me a repair bill of $7,611.

While marketed as a visual enhancement, this mode is extremely distracting when the vehicle is in motion. The constantly strobing and pulsating lights inside the cabin draw the driver’s attention away from the road, especially during night driving when the effect is brightest. Details of the Issue: •The light pulses are highly dynamic and mimic stage lighting or flashing effects, which compete for the driver’s visual attention. •The distraction is more severe in low-light or nighttime driving conditions, where the contrast between the pulsating interior lights and the dark environment is stark. •The rapid changes in brightness and color can momentarily impair night vision when the driver looks back toward the windshield. •There does not appear to be a safety lockout that prevents the mode from operating while the car is in motion. Safety Concern: This feature increases visual distraction for the driver and may impair safe operation of the motor vehicle. The flashing lights could also pose a potential risk for individuals sensitive to strobe effects or conditions like photosensitive epilepsy. Allowing this mode to run while driving is a safety hazard.

This problem applies to non-FSD (Full Self Driving) Tesla Model Y cars.  Tesla's manual describes Autopilot as Traffic Aware Cruise Control - it's the first step on non-FSD cars.  The second step on non-FSD cars, Autosteer, is active lane keeping. In older Ys, the first stalk pull engages autopilot, second pull engages autosteer.  2026 Juniper doesn't have a stalk - a single scroll wheel press engages both.  I read the 300 page Juniper 2026 Model Y manual before driving it for the first time. On page 108, it lists 7 things that will cause autopilot to disengage. I presumed that comprehensive list was complete. unable to attach.  Having *autopilot* disengage when turning the wheel in *autosteer* is not listed.  During my 59K miles on my 2021 Model  Y, I used autosteer for at least 20K miles. Turning the wheel in autosteer did *not* disengage autopilot.  In my first emergency situation in the 2026 Juniper Model Y, turning the wheel *did* disengage autopilot, and the regen properly kicked in for the disengagement.   This action came very close to causing a serious accident.  My objections are 1) the action of *autopilot* (disengage / remain engaged) when the wheel is turned in *autosteer* is not documented, and 2) it's different between the old and new Ys using the same current software.  I understand there were problems with autopilot remaining engaged, and perhaps the change was a good idea; that's an entirely different discussion.  Make the action consistent and document it and I'm happy.  Summary: In heavy traffic, while on autopilot / autosteer (cruise + active lane keeping), the car beside me suddenly tried to pull into my lane.  I made an emergency lane change by turning the wheel, but the cruise also disengaged, (contrary to operation in the prior model) and went to maxiumum regen braking, causing the car behind me in the new lane to nearly rear-end me.

Four days ago, I got a new 2026 Tesla Model Y.   The new Y has made a change to the interaction of the cruise control and automatic lane keeping.  In the old one, first cruise was enabled, then lane keeping.  If you disengaged lane keeping by overriding the steering wheel, cruise control was maintained. In the new Y, a single selection enables both cruise and lane keeping.  The safety issue is that overriding lane keeping by turning the steering wheel disengages both features at once - the old method kept cruise control enabled. I was driving in heavy traffic today on a 6 lane interstate with cruise and lane keeping enabled.  The car next to me abruptly swerved into my lane, causing me to make an emergency lane change to avoid a collision.  When I overrode the lane keeping to avoid the other car by turning the steering wheel, my cruise control also disengaged (unlike the old system), which caused maximum regenerative braking to kick in, abruptly slowing me in the new lane.  I had to punch the accelerator to avoid being rear-ended in the new lane. This change in lane-keeping / cruise control applies to all new 2025/2026 Model Ys - the ""Juniper"" model update. This change, according to Reddit and Facebook forums, seems to be universally hated and many other drivers have raised the same safety concerns.  I agree with them, but didn't make a report until now because I had not yet experienced an issue where this almost contributed to a high-speed crash. thank you.",False,False
