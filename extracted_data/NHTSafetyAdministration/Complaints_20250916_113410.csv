While marketed as a visual enhancement, this mode is extremely distracting when the vehicle is in motion. The constantly strobing and pulsating lights inside the cabin draw the driver’s attention away from the road, especially during night driving when the effect is brightest. Details of the Issue: •The light pulses are highly dynamic and mimic stage lighting or flashing effects, which compete for the driver’s visual attention. •The distraction is more severe in low-light or nighttime driving conditions, where the contrast between the pulsating interior lights and the dark environment is stark. •The rapid changes in brightness and color can momentarily impair night vision when the driver looks back toward the windshield. •There does not appear to be a safety lockout that prevents the mode from operating while the car is in motion. Safety Concern: This feature increases visual distraction for the driver and may impair safe operation of the motor vehicle. The flashing lights could also pose a potential risk for individuals sensitive to strobe effects or conditions like photosensitive epilepsy. Allowing this mode to run while driving is a safety hazard. Request: NHTSA should investigate whether Tesla’s Sync with Music ambient light feature complies with federal motor vehicle safety standards related to driver distraction and interior illumination, and whether restrictions should be placed on its use when the vehicle is not in “Park.”"

This problem applies to non-FSD (Full Self Driving) Tesla Model Y cars.  Tesla's manual describes Autopilot as Traffic Aware Cruise Control - it's the first step on non-FSD cars.  The second step on non-FSD cars, Autosteer, is active lane keeping. In older Ys, the first stalk pull engages autopilot, second pull engages autosteer.  2026 Juniper doesn't have a stalk - a single scroll wheel press engages both.  I read the 300 page Juniper 2026 Model Y manual before driving it for the first time. On page 108, it lists 7 things that will cause autopilot to disengage. I presumed that comprehensive list was complete. unable to attach.  Having *autopilot* disengage when turning the wheel in *autosteer* is not listed.  During my 59K miles on my 2021 Model  Y, I used autosteer for at least 20K miles. Turning the wheel in autosteer did *not* disengage autopilot.  In my first emergency situation in the 2026 Juniper Model Y, turning the wheel *did* disengage autopilot, and the regen properly kicked in for the disengagement.   This action came very close to causing a serious accident.  My objections are 1) the action of *autopilot* (disengage / remain engaged) when the wheel is turned in *autosteer* is not documented, and 2) it's different between the old and new Ys using the same current software.  I understand there were problems with autopilot remaining engaged, and perhaps the change was a good idea; that's an entirely different discussion.  Make the action consistent and document it and I'm happy.  Summary: In heavy traffic, while on autopilot / autosteer (cruise + active lane keeping), the car beside me suddenly tried to pull into my lane.  I made an emergency lane change by turning the wheel, but the cruise also disengaged, (contrary to operation in the prior model) and went to maxiumum regen braking, causing the car behind me in the new lane to nearly rear-end me.  Punching the accelerator during the surprising braking avoided the collision."

Four days ago, I got a new 2026 Tesla Model Y.   The new Y has made a change to the interaction of the cruise control and automatic lane keeping.  In the old one, first cruise was enabled, then lane keeping.  If you disengaged lane keeping by overriding the steering wheel, cruise control was maintained. In the new Y, a single selection enables both cruise and lane keeping.  The safety issue is that overriding lane keeping by turning the steering wheel disengages both features at once - the old method kept cruise control enabled. I was driving in heavy traffic today on a 6 lane interstate with cruise and lane keeping enabled.  The car next to me abruptly swerved into my lane, causing me to make an emergency lane change to avoid a collision.  When I overrode the lane keeping to avoid the other car by turning the steering wheel, my cruise control also disengaged (unlike the old system), which caused maximum regenerative braking to kick in, abruptly slowing me in the new lane.  I had to punch the accelerator to avoid being rear-ended in the new lane. This change in lane-keeping / cruise control applies to all new 2025/2026 Model Ys - the ""Juniper"" model update. This change, according to Reddit and Facebook forums, seems to be universally hated and many other drivers have raised the same safety concerns.

This situation posed a serious safety risk — had the remaining nuts failed while driving, the wheel could have detached entirely, potentially leading to a crash or injury. I noticed the issue during a basic inspection many miles after the pickup. I was forced to buy and install a replacement lug nut myself to make the vehicle roadworthy and safe to drive. I have the propf that the vehicule was handed over to me with a missing lug nut as the video I took during tje check in shows the missing lug nut.   The issue was confirmed independently by me, and I informed the rental company immediately. They acknowledged the problem and promised to refund the cost of the part. However, it has now been over two months, and they have neither issued the refund nor provided any follow-up.  The vehicle was not inspected by police, manufacturer, or insurance, as I managed to resolve the issue myself to avoid driving in unsafe conditions.

They did not reply.  But text a day after stating that we must have gone through a pothole at high speed or hit something,and we were liable for the cost.After my mother sent an email and spoke with them saying that if it was not caused by us,that if the issue was there,was it caused during transporting the car from The manufacturer to the dealer?they said that the car was fixed and there would be no charge but kept insisting that we were at fault,that it happens alot,where people walk out of the dealer and come back with something broken the next day.

My mother lost my father two years ago and this was the first car she purchased on her own and now she is terrified.  We asked Acura to help assist changing her out of this car and they simply refused through the manager of the dealership indicating they did nothing wrong and they have replaced the $8k part.  Since she bought the vehicle in April 2025 and this happened just 6 weeks later, that does not give us comfort.  The dealership was helpful and we were able to get her into a different kind of vehicle although she had to pay $8k more and she is on a fixed income.

The car was 5 months old with just over 3000 miles at the time and there were no prior issues and no advanced warning when this happened.  The dealer (Acura of Berlin in CT) stated they have seen this issues several times.  The battery voltage was low (11.98-12.09 volts), although the car was being driven at highway speeds for at least 45 minutes before the incident.  They charged and tested the battery, and their diagnostics said the battery was good.  They also found a code ""DTC U3000-49 EPS CONTROL UNIT INTERNAL CIRCUIT MALFUNCTION"".  The dealer opened an incident with the Acura Tech line,  who indicated that if the problem happens again they should replace the steering rack.  No repair other than battery charging was performed.    This is an unacceptable safety risk waiting for it to happen again.  There are many reports of this exact problem online from 2025 Acura RDX owners.  We need an immediate recall."

The dash displayed: “Electric Power Steering System Problem. Steering Assist Not Available. Do Not Drive.” This was not just a loss of assist. The wheel felt like it was resisting input and was nearly impossible to turn, locking the car into an off-road path. I narrowly missed a curb and a large tree by inches, only avoiding collision by forcing the wheel with maximum effort while applying heavy brakes. If this had occurred at higher speed or on a mountain road, the result could have been catastrophic.  Once stopped, five additional warnings appeared: Brake System Problem, Lane Keeping Assist System Problem, Collision Mitigation Braking System Problem, Road Departure Mitigation System Problem, and Low Speed Braking Control Problem. After restarting, most warnings remained, though steering assist and brakes seemed temporarily normal. I cautiously drove to a nearby lot, then to the dealership.  At the service center, the errors cleared only after shutting down the engine. Staff first suggested a “loose battery cable.” When I mentioned that other 2025 RDX owners have reported the same issue, I was told not to trust the internet. They kept the vehicle overnight under warranty. Initially no loaner vehicle was available, which forced my wife to leave work for daycare pickup. After she called management directly, a loaner was provided.  At the time of this report, no diagnosis has been given. Service staff speculated it could be nothing or it could be a failed steering column, which matches reports from other owners.  This sudden steering failure, combined with simultaneous warnings across multiple safety systems, created an immediate risk of serious crash.

We asked Acura to help assist changing her out of this car and they simply refused through the manager of the dealership indicating they did nothing wrong and they have replaced the $8k part.

Two weeks into the lease i was attempting to back my car out of a parking spot at work, during a rainstorm, and the vehicle applied the brakes, grinding me to a sudden halt. It thought the rain was an obstacle. I tried several times to back out of the parking space and each time the car, without any other warning, slammed on the brakes. I called my salesperson who requested I contact the service center, who requested that I bring the vehicle in to be looked at. I was told that the vehicle should not be acting that way. After having the vehicle for 24 hours they called me to say there were no malfunctions or errors recorded in the system and I could come get the car. They told me that they were not able to ""simulate rain"" to test the issue adequately. A couple of weeks later it happened again. This time I was attempting to leave my garage, again in the rain, and I could not do so. The vehicle continued to halt each time I tried to back up. The car went back to the service center who had it for a full week, from 7/23/24 - 7/30/24, just to tell me that the issue I am referring to is actually ""normal behavior and is a feature of the car"" and they said that it could be turned off. When I picked up the car, the feature they turned off was the Rear Cross Traffic Assist (RCTA). However, that is a feature that I want to be able to use and nowhere in the owner's manual or anywhere I can find does it say that rain will stop the vehicle. I do understand how the RCTA is meant to work and I do want to have an audible and visual warning of objects or people impeding my path. However, I do not want the vehicle thinking that rain is an obstacle. I do have videos of this occurring."

It also renders the phone being charged inoperable due to overheating shutdown which is equally a safety hazard if there were to be a need to report an emergency. This condition has caused iphone device damage to the battery which could be a serious issue even outside the car after the phone has been removed from the charger pad. Stressing the battery pack over time could cause the phone to explode at any time. This includes public places or god forbid on an airplane.   This is a widely documented issue on AudiWorld forums and online. Other users have mentioned reporting this issue to NHTSA with variation of severity. I also read that this affects iPhones more than other brands devices due to the type of wireless charging iPhone devices use. Audi advertises the charger works with all wireless charging phones. Many wireless chargers exist that don’t cause this heat issue so it’s clearly an Audi hardware issue.  My particular experience, the charging pad caused my phone to overheat to the point where it shutdown and was no longer able to give me nav notifications or make phone calls. Upon touching the phone it was so hot it burned my hand which put myself and others on the road at risk. My partners iPhone was damaged and needed to be replaced by using this charging pad with a case on the phone which many people have. This is an expensive phone replacement with iPhones over $1000.   Any newer Audi with the phone charging pad package will repeat the issue with iPhones with wireless charging. I have tried and confirmed iPhone heating issue in 2 vehicles myself Many people have this experience per online forums. Many have gone to a dealer and it’s apparent it’s a known issue but refuse to provide a fix. There was no warning or indication of the issue from the Audi side of things. Only the iPhone indicated it was going thermal and shut down."

The car was at rest, waiting for traffic light to turn green. Then the car started to move forward, and suddenly hit the car in front with a big thrust. My foot was on the brake trying to stop the car, but I felt like being hit by another car behind me, twice, the second time being the final thrust. My wife on the passenger side also felt the car shaking before the collision. Looking back after the collision, there was actually no car hitting mine. I believe the braking system failed. I have downloaded the video recordings from the car, with 30 seconds before and 30 seconds after the accident, by front, rear, left and right cameras, confirming that the car was at rest for about 20 seconds, then moving forward, and finally accelerating with a big thrust into the collision. I wish to have the Event Data Recorder (EDR) data to verify the pressure I applied on the brake pedal (or/and the pressure on the accelerator pedal as others may speculate that I did), to nail down the facts.  Two cars in front of mime were damaged, and one lady driver had injury. Luckily all cars were initially at rest. With higher speed and such brake failure it can cause deaths.  I have reported the problem to the BMW dealer in Rockville, Maryland. I will report to BMW manufacturer too. The dealer said BMW can send engineer to pull the EDR data and investigate. It will take time though.  I have reported the accident to insurance company. I'll talk with the insurance agent assigned to the case next Monday, to discuss what he wants to do for inspection.  In addition to the brake failure, there was no automatic emergency braking, or forward collision warning, as in my previous leased BMW car. The dealer did set up safety features before leasing the car to me, such as the video recording 30 seconds before and after. This makes the accident more surprising."

Given the prolonged delay and the material impact on my business, I respectfully request that BMW provide appropriate financial relief or compensation, which may include: •A credit or reimbursement for lease payments made during the period of inoperability, •The option to terminate or exchange the lease without penalty. This situation has been ongoing for well over a year, and I believe BMW has a responsibility to ensure that customers — especially those who rely on their vehicles for business purposes — are not left bearing the cost of a vehicle that cannot be safely used. I appreciate your immediate attention to this matter and look forward to a fair resolution. Sincerely,  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)"

While the system was guiding the vehicle into the garage—as it has successfully done many times before—it suddenly and erratically turned the steering wheel to the right, failed to stop, and struck another parked vehicle.  There were no sensor warnings, no audible beeps, and the system did not engage the brakes to avoid the collision. My father was attentive and had to manually slam on the brakes, but the impact had already occurred.  We reported the incident to our local BMW dealership and BMW North America. However, the response has been extremely unsatisfactory. A BMW engineer claimed the system was “working as intended,” even though the erratic behavior and failure to stop contradict that claim. Representatives implied the system requires full attentiveness, but my father was alert and monitoring the process. No one from BMW has taken responsibility, and they have refused to assist in repairing the vehicle damage caused by their system’s failure.  This incident highlights a serious safety issue with BMW’s Parking Assistance system, which can misbehave even when used correctly and attentively.

I am reaching out regarding ongoing issues with my 2025 BMW X7, which I purchased new. Shortly after purchase, I noticed that cavity fluid began leaking from all four doors and the tailgate. I contacted BMW, and they instructed me to take the vehicle to the service center at the dealership where I made the purchase.  The dealership kept the car for 10 days, and when I picked it up, I noticed that the cavity fluid had damaged the paint on the bottom of the doors. I immediately brought this to the service representative’s attention, and they asked me to leave the vehicle again, sending it to the body shop for repairs.  After 7 days, I collected the car, but unfortunately, within two weeks, the cavity fluid began leaking again in the same areas. I returned the vehicle to the service center for the third time, and as of today, it has been another 10 days without receiving the vehicle back.  Given the persistent nature of this issue, I contacted BMW to request a return of the vehicle and a refund, but I have not had any success with this request.

The dealership service department was able to reproduce the issue, confirmed that it was a cracked transmission casing,  resulting in fluid leak, causing electrical failure and leading to mechanical failure.  BMW head office was contacted By the dealership service department and new transmission was requested.  Please refer to pages 3 and 4 of the service report attached for details.  This is a brand-new vehicle, bought directly from dealership 5 months ago, and had been driven with caution and care. No prior indicators were ever noticed.  My safety and safety of nearby vehicles was compromised due to the fact that power was suddenly lost and engine failure unexpectedly occured at such low mileage in fastr flowing traffic.

I began to drive slowly through a parking lot and it took over 200 lbs of pressure to bring the car to a complete slow stop.  I pulled over and turned off the car. I tried rebooting the car and did so assuming it was a bug in the system.  When the car powered back up the flaw had vanished and I carefully drove home.  A short time later when I turned the car on I followed the instructions and called roadside service and described my situation.  To my surprise, roadside service had never heard of the problem before.  I then contacted Rusnak BMW service center and talked them through what was happening.  Once again I was surprised to learn that they too had never heard of the problem. I brought the car into Rusnak BMW on May 30th.  Over the course of the next week and a half I was never given any concrete news about why the car had acted that way.  In fact I was told that they had to elevate the situation to NEW JERSEY where the higher ups would review the situation.  No concrete information was provided other than they drove the car for 11 miles and felt comfortable having me pickup the car.  Admittedly, it was frustrating to be called to pickup my car not knowing why there was a problem with the braking system and being given no assurances it wouldn't happen again.  As I went to leave the Rusnak dealership my car wouldn't start and the process began all over as it had on [XXX].   When I got the car to start the brakes were not reacting and I drove the car 100 feet to the front door of BMW front door and with over 200lbs brought the car to a stop.

Since I believe the issue is not with the vehicle itself, but with Road Information used by Super Cruise, I have reported this to GM Customer Service but not to a dealer. Monday August 25, 2025 Canada – Nova Scotia and New Brunswick While driving on Super Cruise (SC) at 75 MPH in the right lane of a 4 lane freeway (2 lanes each direction), three times the vehicle attempted to enter a non-existent right lane, driving onto the right shoulder and heading for a guardrail.  In each case SC warned me of the lane change with normal alerts of seat vibration, right turn signal activation and the DIC display showing an image of a right lane, in green, indicating the lane was safe to enter.  However, in each case there was only a partial lane or no lane at time the vehicle crossed the white line. I was alert, and surprised of its action which I did not initiate; and before taking control I waited about 3 seconds to see if SC would stop the maneuver and return to the proper lane.  But in each case the vehicle entered the shoulder and appeared to continue, getting close to a guardrail. •The 1st incident occurred on Nova Scotia Hwy 104 at exit 29 where the vehicle attempted to enter the entrance lane at the point where it ended, at 9 AM ADT. •The 2nd incident occurred on New Brunswick Hwy 2 at exit 211 where the vehicle attempted to enter the entrance lane at the point where it ended, at 12 PM ADT. •The 3rd incident occurred again on New Brunswick Hwy 2, at exit175 where the vehicle attempted to enter the exit lane at the point where it ended at, 12:30PM ADT. Weather was sunny and dry with good visibility.  Traffic was extremely light. I have since driven on SC approximately 400 miles without incident.

As I exited the ramp and attempted to slow down, the brake pedal went soft and unresponsive. I had no ability to stop my vehicle, and in a moment of panic, I swerved into a curb to avoid hitting other cars or pedestrians. This caused damage to my rim and tire, but thankfully I avoided a major crash or injury.  I had the vehicle towed to the dealership, where they diagnosed a master cylinder failure. The car is currently being repaired under warranty, but I no longer feel safe driving it. I suffer from anxiety and have been experiencing panic attacks and nightmares since the incident. I am deeply afraid of getting back into a car that nearly killed me. This is a brand-new vehicle and a brake failure of this magnitude should never happen — let alone within the first month of ownership.  GM/Buick has offered to repair the car but not replace it, and I was informed I do not qualify for lemon law because this has only occurred once. That doesn’t change the fact that I experienced a catastrophic and life-threatening failure that could have resulted in serious injury or death. I am filing this report because I believe this is a manufacturing defect that poses a danger to others. A single failure of this kind is enough to destroy trust in the safety of a vehicle. If this happened to someone else, the outcome could be tragic.  Please investigate this issue before someone loses their life."

The driver-side rear window trim completely detached, and the passenger side is now partially detached. The detached piece was found inside the wash tunnel, confirming it came off during the wash.  The trim is made of thin black metal and has sharp edges. The remaining trim is at risk of detaching during normal highway use, especially since I live near railroad crossings, and drive in Florida weather conditions including heavy rain, humidity, and heat.  Automatic car washes operate at 1,000–1,200 psi, far exceeding any natural wind or rain conditions. This shows that the trim’s adhesive is not strong enough for routine car maintenance, even when used as intended. There was no warning in the owner’s manual advising against automatic car washes.  Because the trim is in a blind spot, I cannot monitor it while driving. The dealership told me to retain the loose trim until replacement parts arrive, but that is unrealistic and unsafe. If the trim detaches at highway speed, it could become road debris, potentially hitting another vehicle or causing an accident.  I have already reported this issue to the manufacturer, and it is being processed as a warranty repair. However, I was instructed to ensure the loose trim doesn’t fall off, as the dealership is required to return it to Buick. This expectation places unreasonable responsibility on the driver, despite the fact that the part is already failing under normal conditions.  This is not cosmetic — it is a safety issue caused by insufficient adhesive or trim design. I respectfully request NHTSA investigate whether this defect warrants a Technical Service Bulletin or recall."

This report seeks to bring to the attention of the NHTSA that additional General Motors, LLC Chevrolet Corvette Models NOT INCLUDED in the Recall Report are virtually identical in design and having the identical safety issue. THE ISSUE: Excess fuel spilled into the fuel filler pocket drains directly into the left-side fan equipped air intake. The air intake is equipped with a thermostatically controlled fan that remains running after engine shutdown if the engine temperature trigger threshold is met. While Safety Recall 25V536 limits the issue to those models equipped with a ""radiator/fan combination"", to exclude the ""fan only"" models (Stingray Z51 Equipped in particular) from the recall due to not containing an ""ignition source"" is short-sighted to state the least in my opinion. Any electric motor is an ignition source as power (typically 12VDC in an automobile) is delivered through ""brushes"" to an armature that excites the magnetic fields between opposing magnets. The assumption that the addition of a radiator (essentially a sealed cavity have no spark potential) creates an ignition source combination is short-sighted at the least and criminally negligent at best. I am the owner of a 2025 Stingray with a Z51 package. After reviewing 25V536, I conducted a test on my vehicle by pouring water into the fuel filler pocket and monitored where that water went. The test results made it clear to me that to exclude the Stingray is a mistake. Video test results are attached."

Incident Summary: Since purchasing the motorcycle in June 4,2025. have experienced three complete rear brake failures in less than two months, each occurring after warranty repairs:  1. 6/15/2025 – First ride after purchase: Rear brakes failed; smoke observed near exhaust. Returned to dealer (Moto Forza) on 6/17/2025. Dealer kept the bike for ~1 month for warranty repair related to brake line heat damage.  2. 7/19/2025 – Second occurrence: Rear brakes failed again. Returned for service.  3. 8/10/2025 – Third occurrence: Rear brakes failed completely, with blue/bronze discoloration of the rotor indicating excessive heat exposure. Returned to dealership  This motorcycle has been out of service for over seven weeks since ownership.  Manufacturer’s Response: Ducati’s regional representative has indicated verbally that my lowering of the motorcycle caused the brake failures and that I would not qualify for a manufacturer buyback. I dispute this claim for the following reasons:  Lowering motorcycles is common and has not caused brake failures on any of the multiple bikes I’ve owned and lowered in my 9 years of riding experience.  There is an active recall for the exact brake defect I am experiencing, which affects stock, unmodified 2025 Ducati Panigale V4 models.  Multiple owners have reported repeated rear brake failures in unmodified bikes matching my model year and configuration.  Ducati has not provided any written technical evidence to support their claim that lowering caused the defect."

The radio source actually moves the entire menu to another part of the screen. You have to take your attention off the road for far too long to find what you are looking for. The 2025 Explorer has a very dangerous electronic display that requires far too much attention. As stated, some buttons change location, others are too small to see. The cruise control display is minuscule and mixed in with other display components when there is far more than enough unused space on the screen for larger graphics.

The 2025 Explorer has a very dangerous electronic display that requires far too much attention. As stated, some buttons change location, others are too small to see.

Since shortly after purchasing the vehicle in April 2025, I’ve experienced a loud metal-to-metal noise when reversing down my driveway — an incline where the issue consistently presents itself. Timeline of Events: June 9, 2025 – I brought the car to the dealership service department, reporting the metal-on-metal braking sound. Despite the fact that the sound occurs every time I reverse down my driveway, I was told that the dealership could not replicate the issue and was told the noise was “normal.” July 8, 2025 – After escalating my concern to Genesis Customer Service, an arrangement was made for a service technician to pick up my vehicle for further investigation. I captured a video of the technician reversing the car from my driveway, clearly demonstrating the noise. July 10, 2025 – I was contacted again and told that no issues were found, and the braking noise was again dismissed as “normal.” However, I have since received a loaner Genesis GV70 (white in color), which does not exhibit the same noise when backing down the same driveway, proving that the issue is not characteristic of all GV70s. Supporting Evidence: I have video evidence comparing both vehicles (loaner vs. my own) reversing down the same driveway. My car (black GV70) emits a distinct metal-to-metal squealing noise, while the white loaner vehicle does not. The sound has been replicable and consistent since the beginning and raises concerns about the safety and long-term impact on the braking system. Request for NHTSA: I am concerned that this issue may indicate a defect in the braking system or component assembly that could worsen over time, compromise safety, or result in premature failure. I respectfully request that NHTSA investigate this matter further as a potential manufacturer defect in the braking system of the 2025 Genesis GV70"

I was driving around 40mph when the engine suddenly lost power and the immobilization light appeared. I was no longer able to accelerate. I coasted to a side street where the vehicle placed itself in Park. I restarted the vehicle and it worked. The next morning, the vehicle would not start and the immobilization light was present again. After checking the key fobs and battery, roadside assistance and I could not find the issue. Remote start from the app also did not work. It was towed to the dealer for assessment which is where it currently sits.

My current vehicle, which has approximately 3,100 miles on the odometer, experienced catastrophic safety failures on [XXX] in Northern Virginia that could easily have resulted in a severe accident.  While driving on a very busy road, my vehicle suddenly became unable to accelerate beyond 5 miles per hour despite fully depressing the accelerator pedal. This dangerous malfunction forced me to pull over into a parking lot for safety. Upon attempting to restart the vehicle, I encountered another serious issue: the engine continued to turn over even after removing my finger from the ignition button.  Due to these severe safety defects, I am explicitly requesting and will accept nothing less than a complete replacement with a new 2025 Genesis GV70 of identical trim and specifications. This request is non-negotiable given the serious nature of these safety failures and the potential risk to human life they represent.  Vehicle Information: - Model: 2025 Genesis GV70 - VIN: [XXX]  - P [XXX] ] - Current Mileage: 3,100 - Dealer: Genesis, Springfield, VA  These dangerous malfunctions have rendered the vehicle unsafe to operate and unfit for its intended purpose. I require immediate action in the form of:  1. Complete replacement with a new, identical 2025 Genesis GV70 2. Coverage of all associated costs and fees related to the replacement 3. Written confirmation of this replacement within 10 business days  I expect a prompt response detailing how and when this replacement will be executed. This safety incident has been documented and will be reported to all relevant consumer protection agencies.

This truck is equipt with the 3 liter Diesel engine.  While towing the truck computer counts down milage available based on Def level.  The count down is not mile for mile it is an exponential count down.  This factor triggers a series of warnings concerning vehicle operation and impending speed restrictions.  1000 mile DEF range warning is first up.  Followed shortly there after with a 300 mile DEF range warning (700 miles had never been reached to trigger the warning).  The next warning is ""DEF Low (red warning) speed restricted soon"".  Shortly there after a 500 mile count down starts for the first impending speed reduction to 65 MPH max.  This is followed by other speed restrictions that will put the vehicle eventually into a 5 MPH speed restricted mode.  When adding DEF to the tank the level has never been below 60% full.  Its not empty as the gauge and computer indicate.  With each filling of the DEF tank the range you can drive is less and less until the truck is driven without the trailer hooked up.  GM has a service bulletin for this situation that has been in place since September 23, 2024 and no permanent repair of solution has been prescribed.

They did not apply, however about 1 minute after the breakway was pulled the switch began to melt, then almost immediately there was smoke coming from inside the battery compartment and a fire was started by the power wires melting due to a short.    The fire then damaged a hydralic line and hydralic fluid was leaking right next to the flame.     Luckily we had a fire extinguisher handy and quickly disconnected the battery.

The creaking is especially noticeable when making slow turns in parking lots or driveways. It appears to worsen in warmer temperatures and is consistent regardless of road condition. I brought the issue to the dealership's attention, and they kept the vehicle for approximately three weeks. They replaced the clock spring and airbag, claiming the noise was resolved. However, the creaking noise returned shortly after I resumed driving the vehicle.  Brake Popping: There is also a popping/clicking noise coming from the front left brake area, especially when braking or shifting between drive and reverse. The dealership lubricated the brake hardware but did not resolve the issue.  Despite Honda service attempts, the noises persist. Numerous other 2023–2025 Honda Pilot owners have reported similar symptoms online, many citing steering rack/pinion defects or unresolved brake component issues. These defects appear widespread and unresolved by standard dealership repairs.  Safety Concern:  While the issues may currently present as mechanical noises, I am deeply concerned that they may signal underlying defects in critical safety systems—such as steering control and braking performance. Unaddressed, these could potentially lead to steering failure, brake failure, or loss of control, especially during low-speed maneuvers where driver response time may be compromised due to mechanical unpredictability.  Request for Investigation:  I respectfully request that the NHTSA investigate these issues, as they appear to be affecting a growing number of new Honda Pilot vehicles across the 2023 to 2025 model years, the dealership do not know what to do."

The vehicle’s Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system frequently and unexpectedly turns off while driving on the highway, creating a serious road safety hazard. This issue has been happening intermittently since I bought the vehicle, and despite bringing it to Honda’s attention, they have not acknowledged or addressed the problem.  The sudden deactivation of the ACC system can cause unexpected speed changes, forcing the driver to react quickly and potentially leading to hazardous driving conditions. Given the increasing reliance on driver-assist technologies, such malfunctions pose a risk to both the driver and other motorists on the road.  I have reported this issue to my local Honda dealership, but they have not provided a permanent resolution. I am concerned that other Honda Pilot owners may be experiencing the same problem, which could indicate a widespread defect. Therefore, I urge the NHTSA to investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action, including issuing a recall if necessary, to prevent potential accidents.  Please confirm receipt of this complaint and inform me of any next steps. I am available to provide further details or documentation as needed.

The tape's deterioration raises concerns about potential damage to the wiring itself due to heat exposure.  I am also worried about the long-term reliability and safety implications, including the possibility of a fire.  I drove approximately 40 miles round trip to the Honda dealership where I purchased the vehicle.  They dismissed my concerns, stating that this was ""normal"" and simply advised me to purchase more electrical tape from a home improvement store and re-wrap the harness myself.  They refused to perform any repair or replacement.  I question why Honda would not use heat-resistant tape in this engine compartment area, especially given the potential for high temperatures.

An orange steering wheel with an orange exclamation mark next to it popped up on the upper right hand corner of my dashboard along with a red battery logo below it. I was on the roadway unable to turn the car back on for approximately one hour. After continuous failed attempts to turn the car on and change the gear, at one point it turned back on and I was able to drive the car."

The only thing I can think is that it was due to a bicycle that was traveling the same direction at a slower speed than I was driving but I had plenty of room to go around and was not even close to hitting them.  The brakes were activated which was not only scary but dangerous.  Had a car been behind me there is a strong chance I would have been rear-ended because nobody in their right mind would expect me to hit my brakes in this situation. This prompted me to look at the manual where I saw Honda has a list of reasons the emergency braking could activate despite ""little chance of collision"".  The list is extensive with many reasons the system could activate incorrectly causing an accident, not preventing one. The unexpected braking itself is terrifying but how difficult Honda makes it to ""opt out"" of the system that obviously has many flaws is even more concerning.   I tried to turn off this system only to find out that it is a multi step process that can only be done when stopped so if you forget to turn it off you are stuck using it even if you don't trust the system.  Every other safety setting can be turned off while driving except this one.  Why make it so difficult for the driver to choose to have complete control of their car, especially when their system is admittedly flawed.  In addition, the emergency braking system is the only safety feature that resets every time you shut off the car.  So every single time you start the engine you have to go through multiple steps to choose to have control of your own vehicle.  It seems the system that is the most flawed is the only one Honda is trying to force drivers to use.  This is not safe for my family or those driving around me. I called Honda and they told me there is nothing that can be done to disable it and have the setting hold even after turning off the car like all the other safety setting."

Safety Concern:  While the issues may currently present as mechanical noises, I am deeply concerned that they may signal underlying defects in critical safety systems—such as steering control and braking performance. Unaddressed, these could potentially lead to steering failure, brake failure, or loss of control, especially during low-speed maneuvers where driver response time may be compromised due to mechanical unpredictability.  Request for Investigation:  I respectfully request that the NHTSA investigate these issues, as they appear to be affecting a growing number of new Honda Pilot vehicles across the 2023 to 2025 model years, the dealership do not know what to do."

The vehicle’s Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system frequently and unexpectedly turns off while driving on the highway, creating a serious road safety hazard. This issue has been happening intermittently since I bought the vehicle, and despite bringing it to Honda’s attention, they have not acknowledged or addressed the problem.  The sudden deactivation of the ACC system can cause unexpected speed changes, forcing the driver to react quickly and potentially leading to hazardous driving conditions. Given the increasing reliance on driver-assist technologies, such malfunctions pose a risk to both the driver and other motorists on the road.  I have reported this issue to my local Honda dealership, but they have not provided a permanent resolution. I am concerned that other Honda Pilot owners may be experiencing the same problem, which could indicate a widespread defect.

They dismissed my concerns, stating that this was ""normal"" and simply advised me to purchase more electrical tape from a home improvement store and re-wrap the harness myself.  They refused to perform any repair or replacement.  I question why Honda would not use heat-resistant tape in this engine compartment area, especially given the potential for high temperatures.  Using a more robust, heat-resistant material would provide greater safety and prevent the current issue.  I believe this is a design flaw that needs to be addressed."

The only thing I can think is that it was due to a bicycle that was traveling the same direction at a slower speed than I was driving but I had plenty of room to go around and was not even close to hitting them.  The brakes were activated which was not only scary but dangerous.  Had a car been behind me there is a strong chance I would have been rear-ended because nobody in their right mind would expect me to hit my brakes in this situation. This prompted me to look at the manual where I saw Honda has a list of reasons the emergency braking could activate despite ""little chance of collision"".  The list is extensive with many reasons the system could activate incorrectly causing an accident, not preventing one. The unexpected braking itself is terrifying but how difficult Honda makes it to ""opt out"" of the system that obviously has many flaws is even more concerning.   I tried to turn off this system only to find out that it is a multi step process that can only be done when stopped so if you forget to turn it off you are stuck using it even if you don't trust the system.  Every other safety setting can be turned off while driving except this one.  Why make it so difficult for the driver to choose to have complete control of their car, especially when their system is admittedly flawed.  In addition, the emergency braking system is the only safety feature that resets every time you shut off the car.  So every single time you start the engine you have to go through multiple steps to choose to have control of your own vehicle.  It seems the system that is the most flawed is the only one Honda is trying to force drivers to use.  This is not safe for my family or those driving around me.

Additionally, such behavior—if widespread—could be considered a form of consumer deception.  I submitted a detailed written request to an authorized Honda dealership (Victory Honda of San Bruno) asking them to compare actual fuel consumption to the displayed value under controlled conditions. However, the dealership did not perform the required measurements or reset the trip computer, and no technical analysis or documentation was provided. The manufacturer’s customer service reviewed the complaint but closed the case without addressing the technical discrepancy or providing a specification that defines acceptable error for the fuel economy display.  There were no warning lights, error messages, or symptoms indicating a malfunction. The issue was discovered independently through manual tracking of fuel usage versus mileage.  I have attached documentation including my full correspondence with Honda Customer Service, fuel receipts for each fill-up, photographs of the dashboard display showing average fuel consumption, and the official Service Report from Victory Honda."

It is sharp, constant, and noticeably affected by the vehicle’s battery charge and speed.  There are no warning lights, messages, or error indicators. However, the sound is extremely distracting and physically uncomfortable to endure. My wife has a preexisting auditory condition (tinnitus), and this sound makes it extremely difficult to drive or ride in the vehicle without pain or aggravation. It has made the vehicle nearly unusable for her on highways.  I’ve brought this to a dealership, where multiple technicians and even a factory engineer inspected the vehicle. They confirmed the presence of the sound using audio measurement tools, and noted that similar sounds are present in other CR-V Hybrids. Despite this, I was told by the manufacturer that the sound is “normal” and that no fix is currently available.  This issue has been present since I first took possession of the vehicle. The dealership and manufacturer have confirmed that it exists, but no resolution has been provided.

While driving my children to school, my CR-V violently slammed the brakes because a scooter was creeping toward an intersection — clearly not entering traffic. The rider and I made eye contact, fully aware of each other, and there was an open left lane for evasive action if needed (it wasn't). Despite my clear judgment, the CMBS intervened, causing a violent deceleration that launched objects inside the vehicle, scared everyone, and increased the risk of a rear-end collision.  I am shocked that Honda eliminated the hardware button to quickly disable CMBS. Now drivers must perform a multi-step procedure every time the vehicle starts — an unreasonable and unsafe burden. I previously owned a 2014 Accord and was a loyal, satisfied customer. I love nearly everything else about the CR-V, but these flawed ""safety"" systems are a potential deal-breaker. Sudden deceleration can cause concussions and greatly increase the chance of secondary accidents.  Lane Keep Assist has created additional dangers. When I move slightly within my lane to create space from a semi-truck, the system unnecessarily corrects my steering. This is distracting and unsafe. Good drivers adjust dynamically, but these systems undermine good judgment rather than enhancing safety. Technology that overrides competent drivers is reckless, not ""intelligent.""  I request two changes: (1) Reinstate a hardware button to easily disable automatic emergency braking, and (2) Allow CMBS and Lane Keep Assist settings to persist across drives.  Honda must redesign these systems with real-world driving in mind. Features that destroy driver trust are dangerous, not protective.

After driving it for a few weeks, we noticed that the Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) is not functioning. And another safety feature, the Forward Collision Warning (FCW) system is visual only (not audible) and appears only when our vehicle is 5-6 feet from a vehicle in front. Obviously, this distance is insufficient to properly react in order to avoid an accident.  According to the car manual, “the CMBS system can assist when it determines there is a possibility of your vehicle colliding with another vehicle in front…an oncoming vehicle in front, a pedestrian, or someone riding a bicycle. CMBS is designed to alert you when the potential for a collision is determined, as well as assist in reducing speed, avoiding collisions, and reducing collision severity.”  With regard to the non-functioning CMBS, we brought the car back to the dealer several times to check on the lack of this system, but their service department could not detect the CMBS system either. They tested other new Honda CRV EX models and even in those cars they could not detect the CMBS system.  On June 16, 2025 (received June 18), we sent a letter to Honda headquarters (see attached) asking their assistance in addressing this deficiency. We followed up with 2 phone calls on July 25 and August 13. Unfortunately, to no avail. No response received.

From some posts I was reading, I saw that many dealers were refusing to accept these as a warranty claim and some insurance companies were calling these experiences an ""act of God"" and refusing to pay claims. I saw at least one class action lawsuit against Honda for shattering sunroofs.

This discrepancy is repeatable and was observed over multiple refueling intervals. The vehicle and its onboard display system are available for inspection upon request.  This inaccurate fuel economy reading does not present a direct safety hazard, but it can mislead drivers into overestimating range and efficiency, and may influence consumer decisions based on performance data that does not match real-world usage.

I submitted a detailed written request to an authorized Honda dealership (Victory Honda of San Bruno) asking them to compare actual fuel consumption to the displayed value under controlled conditions.

My wife has a preexisting auditory condition (tinnitus), and this sound makes it extremely difficult to drive or ride in the vehicle without pain or aggravation. It has made the vehicle nearly unusable for her on highways.  I’ve brought this to a dealership, where multiple technicians and even a factory engineer inspected the vehicle. They confirmed the presence of the sound using audio measurement tools, and noted that similar sounds are present in other CR-V Hybrids.

While driving my children to school, my CR-V violently slammed the brakes because a scooter was creeping toward an intersection — clearly not entering traffic. The rider and I made eye contact, fully aware of each other, and there was an open left lane for evasive action if needed (it wasn't). Despite my clear judgment, the CMBS intervened, causing a violent deceleration that launched objects inside the vehicle, scared everyone, and increased the risk of a rear-end collision.  I am shocked that Honda eliminated the hardware button to quickly disable CMBS. Now drivers must perform a multi-step procedure every time the vehicle starts — an unreasonable and unsafe burden. I previously owned a 2014 Accord and was a loyal, satisfied customer. I love nearly everything else about the CR-V, but these flawed ""safety"" systems are a potential deal-breaker. Sudden deceleration can cause concussions and greatly increase the chance of secondary accidents.  Lane Keep Assist has created additional dangers. When I move slightly within my lane to create space from a semi-truck, the system unnecessarily corrects my steering. This is distracting and unsafe. Good drivers adjust dynamically, but these systems undermine good judgment rather than enhancing safety. Technology that overrides competent drivers is reckless, not ""intelligent.""  I request two changes: (1) Reinstate a hardware button to easily disable automatic emergency braking, and (2) Allow CMBS and Lane Keep Assist settings to persist across drives.  Honda must redesign these systems with real-world driving in mind. Features that destroy driver trust are dangerous, not protective.

Since the day I brought the vehicle home, I have noticed a persistent clanking or metal-on-metal noise coming from the rear of the vehicle, especially noticeable when driving over minor bumps or rough pavement at low to moderate speeds.  This issue was reported to the dealer, and in June 2025, they attempted a repair by replacing the rear shock absorber and a rear rod assembly. However, the noise returned within weeks, and by mid-July 2025, it has become significantly worse.  Now, the clanking sound is loud and alarming, resembling something coming loose or at risk of falling off. It has reached the point where I feel unsafe driving the vehicle, especially on highways or interstates. I am concerned that a suspension or structural component may fail, potentially leading to a loss of control or an accident.  The fact that this issue has persisted despite repairs and is worsening raises serious concerns about the safety and structural integrity of the rear suspension system on this model.   ---  Additional Notes:  The noise occurs whether the vehicle is loaded or empty.  It is especially pronounced when driving over uneven roads, minor bumps, or potholes.  I have checked the cargo area for loose items—this is clearly a mechanical issue.  The service team initially acknowledged the issue and attempted a fix, but the recurrence suggests either a design flaw or improper rear component durability.  Given that other owners have reported similar noises and rear-end suspension issues on owner forums, I believe this may not be an isolated case.    ---  ️ Safety Concern:  Due to the intensity of the noise and the sensation that rear components may detach, I no longer feel confident driving the vehicle at highway speeds. This poses a serious safety hazard to myself."

Since the day I brought the vehicle home, I have noticed a persistent clanking or metal-on-metal noise coming from the rear of the vehicle, especially noticeable when driving over minor bumps or rough pavement at low to moderate speeds.  This issue was reported to the dealer, and in June 2025, they attempted a repair by replacing the rear shock absorber and a rear rod assembly. However, the noise returned within weeks, and by mid-July 2025, it has become significantly worse.  Now, the clanking sound is loud and alarming, resembling something coming loose or at risk of falling off. It has reached the point where I feel unsafe driving the vehicle, especially on highways or interstates. I am concerned that a suspension or structural component may fail, potentially leading to a loss of control or an accident.  The fact that this issue has persisted despite repairs and is worsening raises serious concerns about the safety and structural integrity of the rear suspension system on this model.   ---  Additional Notes:  The noise occurs whether the vehicle is loaded or empty.  It is especially pronounced when driving over uneven roads, minor bumps, or potholes.  I have checked the cargo area for loose items—this is clearly a mechanical issue.  The service team initially acknowledged the issue and attempted a fix, but the recurrence suggests either a design flaw or improper rear component durability.  Given that other owners have reported similar noises and rear-end suspension issues on owner forums, I believe this may not be an isolated case.    ---  ️ Safety Concern:  Due to the intensity of the noise and the sensation that rear components may detach, I no longer feel confident driving the vehicle at highway speeds. This poses a serious safety hazard to myself."

Not only is the flow of the washer fluid slow, but the mix of wind, car movement and the low flow of fluid, in concert with the wiper movement; resulted in very little fluid actually landing within the visual field of the windshield.  Most of the fluid was either left of the driver field of sight or on the lower part of the Right side of the windshield.

I have not yet had the vehicle inspected by a dealer for this specific issue, but I plan to schedule a service appointment to diagnose the problem. The prior battery replacement suggests potential issues with the electrical system, starter, or related components, possibly linked to the auto start/stop system currently under NHTSA investigation for 2018–2025 Honda Odyssey models.

This was both harmful to me, to the transmission, and is a major defect. Engaging a transmission into park while moving is reckless, harmful and extremely dangerous.   The failing component is most likely the transmission control unit and is available for inspection upon request, but has not been inspected by anyone other than myself.

I was unable to fully depress the brake pedal. In some instances, the pedal felt like it was grinding as I pressed it down. The grinding sound was similar to what you might hear when there’s surface rust on the brakes in the morning, but it was coming from the brake pedal. I had been driving for a while and it hadn’t rained in days. I also felt feedback in the pedal during these instances, even though the issue did not appear to be related to the brake pads or rotors. This reduced my ability to brake effectively, and although I have not been involved in a crash, the safety of myself and those around me on the road was potentially in jeapordy.

I entered a broad curve, which was gentle enough that it was safe to maintain that speed.  Ahead was a left-turn turnout lane for vehicles wanting to make a left turn off the highway.  This turn lane is part of the broad curve, too.  A vehicle was stopped ahead in this appropriate turn-off lane waiting for oncoming traffic to clear.  As my vehicle entered the curve, the radar/camera at the front of my car detected this stopped vehicle a little ahead of me, and immediately began to brake my car into a panic stop.  I was thrown forward a little in the seat, and the vehicle immediately behind me had to suddenly brake, too, in order to avoid read-ending me.  These was no need for this of course.  With conventional cruise control, I would have been able to navigate through the curve at the set speed, and all vehicles in the vicinity, including mine and the vehicle behind me, would have been safe.  The Hyundai owner's manual points out that the SCC may well malfunction in curve situations (among many, many other situations).  Smart Cruise Control is an accident waiting to happen.

The palisade stopped itself after the ABS wouldn't let me stop soon enough to avoid a collision in front of me - almost causing a wreck behind me. With a simple google search, this ABS engaging on rough roads is a major common problem that Hyundai needs to address before we're all paying for wrecks that we didn't cause due to driver neglience but rather the functionality of the vehicle is causing the safety problem.

Hyundai's integration of Forward Attention Warning (FAW) with the ACC prohibits the driver from using ACC while wearing sunglasses. If one is driving the vehicle with ACC engaged and puts on sunglasses, the FAW flashes a warning on the dashboard and disengages the ACC. In order to engage cruise control the driver must interact with the onboard video display system to switch from ACC to ""dumb cruise"". Obviously the driver's attention is distracted while manipulating the selection of cruise control. The driver is also forced to compromise driving safety because they are forced to choose between wearing sunglasses and being able to use ACC. Use of ACC enhances safety especially when driving into the sun or in low visibility situations. The incompatibility of ACC with sunglasses wear then compromises safety. To make matters worse the FAW options screen provides erroneous information. It indicates that the driver can turn off FAW, but turning it off does not in fact turn it off. Turning it off stops the FAW warnings only until the driver turns on and engages ACC at which time ACC apparently forces FAW back on and active. I took the problem to my local Hyundai dealer who confirmed the problem and indicated they could not repair the problem. Since I am considering a Georgia Lemon Law claim, I asked whether I needed to bring the car back since the lemon law gives the dealer/manufacturer 3 tries to fix the problem. The dealer indicated that would be a waste of time because Hyundai will not support/allow the issue to be corrected. The dealer indicated this is a known issue. An Internet search also confirms that Hyundai's FAW + ACC integration is flawed. Additionally it is not clear whether other enhanced vehicle safety systems such as automatic emergency braking are compromised by the wearing of sunglasses?"

There were no warning lights, messages, or symptoms before the failure — the brakes simply stopped working during operation on the freeway.

While we understand and appreciate the many safety features on new cars, we feel this feature is a safety distraction and hazard. We have turned this feature off in the Driver Assistance Warning section and we have turned off the bell.  Despite this, this warning with its 5 loud distinct bells sounds very frequently and often automatically disengages our cruise control while we are driving on the highway. In a recent vacation road trip of over 3,000 miles, the enjoyment of our trip and our new car was greatly compromised.  During that time we tried to discern what actions we were doing to cause it to go off.  It would go off when looking at the gauges so we would try to look quick and then eyes back on the road.  We tried driving without sunglasses (which is a hazard  itself), making sure our hands were at the 11 and 2 position, looking straight ahead.  Nothing seemed to make a difference, it would go off randomly and often. Careful and safe driving requires a driver to scan the rear view and side mirrors, the gauges, be aware of other drivers proximity to your vehicle and avoid staring only straight ahead.  I am aware that there may be consideration of a mandate for all cars with this feature in the future, however, as of the time of purchase of this vehicle, this law did not exist and as such, we should have the right to choose to use this feature or not. We have contacted Hyundai Corporate and visited 3 dealers, none of whom would or could help except to tell us many others have voiced the same complaint.

After researching this online and looking up the Hyundai Manual, when you activate cruise control it automatically activates lane assist which automatically activates the Forward Attention Warning which, at that point, deactivates the cruise IF you are either wearing sunglasses or blocking the view of your face from the steering column camera using say your arm.  The ""assistance"" does not allow you to drive with your arm at the top of the steering wheel, I was getting tired using both arms on each side and had to give one of my arms a rest only to realize this was an issue and couldn't.  Add to this that it was sunny and could not use sunglasses as the camera couldn't see my eyes.  I researched this online and there's several recent videos and Reddit messages across various platforms that this is a major issue for people and a serious risk for some as they can not use sunglasses on sunny days and the fact it automatically deactivates after a while.

The problem is that while driving in what Hyundai calls HDA (Highway Driving Assist) which activates when the car is placed in adaptive cruise control (cruise control that keeps the vehicle at a set speed and distance from the cars ahead) and lane driving assist (driving assist to keep the vehicle centered in the lane) the car issues far too many false warnings telling the driver to ""keep your eyes on the road"". While in HDA, the car monitors the driver's eyes and head position using a driver facing camera, part of the FAW (Forward Attention Warning system) or DDMS (Direct Driver Monitoring System) to assure the driver is focused on the road ahead. However, in the 2025 Hyundai, this system is so flawed that the car is practically undrivable in the HDA mode with cruise control and lane driving assist engaged issuing too many false warnings, that the driver is not focusing on the road.

While attempting to change lanes at highway speed, the driver behind me failed to see my turn signal and collided with my vehicle. I believe the cause was the unusually low placement of the rear bumper-mounted turn signals, which creates a direct visibility flaw.  The Tucson’s turn signals are mounted low on the rear bumper instead of at eye level within the taillight assembly. This design makes them especially difficult to see in two critical conditions:  Bright Sunlight: The low-mounted signals are easily washed out in daytime conditions, reducing visibility to following drivers.  Low Light/Traffic Conditions: At night or in heavy traffic, larger vehicles and brake light glare further obscure the signals.  In my case, the driver behind me could not see my intent to switch lanes, and despite my efforts to avoid a collision, the lack of visible signaling directly led to a frontal driver’s side impact.  This design presents an ongoing highway safety hazard:  Poor Visibility: Low placement reduces signal recognition in both bright and low light.  Accident Risk: My collision demonstrates the real-world consequences of this flaw.  Durability Concerns: Bumper-level placement exposes wiring to water, debris, and road wear, raising the risk of malfunction.  Although the accident resulted in minor damage, the potential for severe outcomes at highway speeds is significant. I respectfully request NHTSA to investigate this design flaw and evaluate whether corrective action (recall, retrofit, or advisory) is warranted.

They pose a hazard in a number of ways from when the car is stopped to driving on multi-lane highways.  For instance, the adaptive cruise control is linked to an over the air network.  If that link is ""cut"" by going through the mountains, cruise control suddenly quits; this has happened while passing a vehicle over a mountain pass.  When attempting to pull out from a parking spot, another driver stopped to wait for me because they wanted my parking spot.  My car stopped by itself, sounded a loud noise, steering wheel shook, my wife screamed at the noise, and I had to shift out of reverse and shift back into it and attempt to leave the parking spot.  When driving in the mountains on curvy mountain roads, my eyes shift around a great deal to keep on top of the road and traffic conditions.  This sets off the ""its time to take a coffee break"" announcement with accompanying dinging.  This continues every few minutes until I am out of the mountains - it is distracting at the least.  If the adaptive cruise has slowed the car down because of slower traffic ahead, and after a car passes in the outer lane, you pull into that lane to pass the slower car; but when you do, my car accelerates quickly to bring the speed up to the speed set on the cruise control.  If the car that just passed is too close, this acceleration sends us hurling toward the other car.  I would like the ability to turn these ""safety"" features OFF.  But that is NOT POSSIBLE with the 2025 model - while it was in earlier models.

When driving in heavy traffic at speed, this is too distracting.  There is no way to turn it off. 2.  Camera focused on the driver.  If I take a drink from my water bottle, looking around the water bottle to see the road, the camera can not see my face/eyes.  It then shuts off my cruise control, makes a noise, scares my wife, and distracts me from driving.  This has happened to me in heavy urban traffic going through cities on my last trip.   3.  The cruise control is linked to communication from outside the car.  When driving in the mountains, there are times when the signal is lost, the cruise control stops working, the car emits a noise signally a problem, my wife screams, I lose concentration on what is going on as the car decelerates quickly and the semi truck behind me comes very close to the rear of the car.

I am the original owner and purchased the vehicle brand new, directly off the truck. It has now been to the dealership four separate times for the same persistent “Check User Authentication” electrical issue.  Most recently, the driver display screen went completely blank while driving and flashed a green “No Signal” warning. This made it impossible to see speed, warning indicators, fuel level, or other critical driving information. Losing all visibility of this data while in motion is extremely dangerous and creates a serious safety risk.  The dealership first said it was caused by loose coax cables from the factory, but the problem continues. I also experienced a sudden, complete electrical failure while driving. The instrument cluster and infotainment shut off, speakers went dead, and all charging ports lost power. The Head-Up Display (HUD) also failed during this same event. Restarting the car temporarily restored function, but the failure happened randomly and without explanation.  The air conditioning system now loses power and restarts while driving. The dealership has had the vehicle for over a month with no resolution. Hyundai corporate is involved with multiple case numbers, but no permanent fix has been found.  The most alarming event was when every major dash warning light came on at once: ABS, Power Steering, Traction Control, Stability Control, AFS, EPB, and Battery. These lights stayed on even after shutting off the vehicle and fully drained the battery.  These repeated failures pose a serious threat to driver and passenger safety.

At around 8:30 am on a sunny clear day the driver was maneuvering slowly up a ramp between first and second floors of a parking garage at the college campus where the driver works.  Driver paused the vehicle and slowly turned to the right to park in an open spot about halfway up the ramp.  There was a large concrete pillar to the right of the parking spot and a low steel cable wall at the end of the parking space along the inner structure of the garage. While turning into the space, the driver described suddenly feeling ""a loss of control of the vehicle"" wherein it ""felt like it was in neutral and wouldn't stop"". The car hit the wall with extreme force, enough for resulting in minor injuries, damaging the frond end and a total loss to the vehicle.  The force was enough to rebound the car back approximately 30 feet from the wall after impact.  No help or warnings from the collision detection mechanisms was apparent.  In a single prior time during the tenure of ownership (approximately 6 months) the collision detection system had intervened and manually stopped the vehicle on its own due to a car that had erroneously driven in front of the vehicle too closely.  The car's lane assist successfully kept itself in lanes on most occasions.  Several software related notices on the car dash had been reported during the tenure of ownership and in no case was the dealership able to figure out what was wrong in any of the scenarios, one of the software notices on the dash did end up just ""going away"" after some time."

We let the SUV sit for a few moments and turned it off. We let it sit for a minute and then turned the car back on. The SUV when we turned it back on gave us a check engine light and still would not go over 10 mph. Luckily we were stopping for dinner. We were able to proceed to our destination.

Hyundai's integration of Forward Attention Warning (FAW) with the ACC prohibits the driver from using ACC while wearing sunglasses. If one is driving the vehicle with ACC engaged and puts on sunglasses, the FAW flashes a warning on the dashboard and disengages the ACC. In order to engage cruise control the driver must interact with the onboard video display system to switch from ACC to ""dumb cruise"". Obviously the driver's attention is distracted while manipulating the selection of cruise control. The driver is also forced to compromise driving safety because they are forced to choose between wearing sunglasses and being able to use ACC. Use of ACC enhances safety especially when driving into the sun or in low visibility situations. The incompatibility of ACC with sunglasses wear then compromises safety. To make matters worse the FAW options screen provides erroneous information. It indicates that the driver can turn off FAW, but turning it off does not in fact turn it off. Turning it off stops the FAW warnings only until the driver turns on and engages ACC at which time ACC apparently forces FAW back on and active. I took the problem to my local Hyundai dealer who confirmed the problem and indicated they could not repair the problem. Since I am considering a Georgia Lemon Law claim, I asked whether I needed to bring the car back since the lemon law gives the dealer/manufacturer 3 tries to fix the problem. The dealer indicated that would be a waste of time because Hyundai will not support/allow the issue to be corrected. The dealer indicated this is a known issue. An Internet search also confirms that Hyundai's FAW + ACC integration is flawed. Additionally it is not clear whether other enhanced vehicle safety systems such as automatic emergency braking are compromised by the wearing of sunglasses?"

It was difficult to see through the windshield. We also noticed the same defect on the other windows, however, not as bad. We contacted the dealership and subsequently brought it into their service center for inspection. They confirmed the visibility defect and ordered a new factory replacement windshield and installed it. The replacement windshield, while not perfectly clear of spots, was acceptable for safe driving. The original windshield had such poor visibility in certain conditions that it would be hard to see anything, which would be hazardous while driving. We took possession of the car after the windshield replacement was completed but still feel that the spots on the other windows are a manufacturing defect but do not necessarily create a hazard. Along with employees of Earnhardt dealership, we looked at other brand new 2025 Hyundai vehicles of varying makes and models and observed the same windshield defect in many of the cars we looked at on their sales lot. This does not appear to be an isolated incident, but the dealership said that we were the first customers to bring it to their attention.

All 5K miles I have had stalling issues. These issues mostly happen when lightly feathering the throttle while pulling out. This issue is not in my clutch work. It seems to be in the throttle sensor. The bike has began to randomly shut down on my while riding. This is always random and cannot be reproduced at will. It does however seem to only happen with a zero throttle position and clutch fully disengaged position (while riding). This is not quite the case when pulling out, the issue presents with a slight throttle and the clutch just starting to friction, if you attempt to throttle the bike dies. The throttle sensor is not correct. Furthermore it seems after the bike has warmed up… like 10 miles and I stop at the store in the mornings, the next start seems to like rock the engine up during startup. This causes a terrible abrupt stop to the engine start and causes the ride command to reboot. This has happened riding furring downshifting at a light where the engine shut off and caused the ride command to reboot, had to coast to the side of the road and wait 20 seconds to get the fuel pump back before it would fire back up. This stalling on the highway has happened 3 times now and without any warning. This is going to get me into an accident. So, the engine stall happened this morning and it actually got the first time threw a check engine light. The absolute first code I have ever been able to see 3464-3 (throttle actuator fault) this solidifies my throttle suspicions all along, as everything has always pointed to the throttle sensor. If Indian does not fix this (there are a ton of people complaining about this same issue on their 2025’s) they are going to hurt or kill someone.

My wife, myself and my son were all there at the time this event transacted. My wife had her Jeep and I was on my bike as I had met them there to do some shopping. While loading my wife’s car I decided to start my bike and start getting a little heat in it before we left.  I approached the bike and pressed the power button, Ride command normally takes over 30 seconds to boot, so I stood there waiting for the screen. Once the screen booted I reach down with my foot and bring the shifter from first to neutral. This can be verified and validated by the audible click of the shifter as well as on the Ride Command screen. The “N” neutral light was clearly visible. The bike still on the stand I reach across the bike and hit the start button.   This is where things started to go from bad to worse. The engine turned over as the bike lurched forward (as if it was still in gear). At this point the engine actually started as the bike left the stand and fell onto its side as well as my legs. The bike was running at this point as it layed on its side for approx 3 seconds until the bike died and the hazards began to flash.   I swiftly checked the rear tire to ensure it was no longer turning and was able to get the bike uprighted within maybe 10 to 15 seconds of it laying over.   Once upright I validated again the bike was displaying neutral and it was. Damage was minimal when it went over there was contact from the left foot peg as well as the clutch lever (broke about two inches off the clutch lever). No other damage on the bike thank god. It only tweaked my back while trying to wrestle the bike as it moved uncontrollably.   This bike allowed two safety’s to be overridden, the neutral safety as well as the stand safety.

I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding an ongoing issue with my 2025 Infiniti QX60, which is equipped with the VC-Turbo engine. I have noticed an abnormal engine vibration while the vehicle is idling, such as when waiting at traffic lights or during stop-and-go driving.  I am concerned because this issue appears to be related to the same VC-Turbo engine that is included in the recent recall for various Nissan and Infiniti models, including the Nissan Rogue, Altima, Infiniti QX50, and QX55, manufactured between 2019 and 2024. However, my 2025 Infiniti QX60, which uses the same engine type, was not included in the recall.  The vibration issue has caused me significant concern about the safety and reliability of my vehicle. Given that the recall addresses engine failures and related risks in the affected models, I believe that my vehicle should be included in the recall as well, as it uses the same engine type and exhibits similar issues.  I kindly request that NHTSA review this matter and include the 2025 Infiniti QX60 in the ongoing recall for VC-Turbo engines. I would appreciate any assistance you can provide in addressing this concern and ensuring the safety of my vehicle."

Please consider this as additional information to the original case. Since my initial submission:  Second Dealership Refusal: I attempted to bring the vehicle to a second authorized Jeep dealership for inspection and diagnosis. They refused any service, stating they would not inspect or repair the vehicle. This is now the second dealership to reject the vehicle after the incident.  Obtained Diagnostic Printouts: Despite refusing service, the second dealership was convinced to provide printed codes from the vehicle. These codes show multiple system errors recorded at a very low vehicle mileage, including communication failures with the ABS control module, brake system internal failure, and CAN bus errors. These indicate potential electronic or computer system faults that could have occurred immediately before or during the brake failure.  Manufacturer Warranty Issue: Immediately after the incident, Jeep opened a warranty case #93917003 for the vehicle. However, during subsequent communication, I was informed that this brand-new vehicle has no manufacturer's warranty at all. This is extremely concerning, as the vehicle was purchased new with only minimal mileage and no prior damage or modifications.  Vehicle Condition: The vehicle remains undrivable and unsafe to operate. Jeep or its authorized dealers have performed no corrective action.  Given that this was a brand-new vehicle with extremely low mileage purchased solely for personal family travel, and that both authorized dealerships have refused to address a major safety defect, I am requesting that NHTSA treat this as an urgent safety matter. The refusal to investigate by Jeep dealerships, combined with the unexpected claim that there is no manufacturer warranty, leaves this defect unresolved and poses an ongoing safety risk if similar failures occur in other vehicles."

However, the first authorized dealer we visited, as was told by the Jeep advisor at 111 58th St., Brooklyn, NY 11220, refused to inspect the brake, ABS, or AEB systems under warranty, after we said that we have case number from Jeep and we need to read the computer while it still has information about the acident in the memory. Also were refused to provide a written denial, and directed us to a collision center instead, which repairs only the body but doesn't have equipment to read the car's faults. Due to this refusal, Jeep Corporate initially closed our case without resolution or notification; we had to insist on having it reopened, as the issue wasn't investigated. We are aware that Jeep models from 2024–2025 (though not exactly this trim) have had recalls for ABS, brake module, and electronic stability control issues, and these systems share similar or identical computer modules across model lines.

Please consider this as additional information to the original case. Since my initial submission:  Second Dealership Refusal: I attempted to bring the vehicle to a second authorized Jeep dealership for inspection and diagnosis. They refused any service, stating they would not inspect or repair the vehicle. This is now the second dealership to reject the vehicle after the incident.  Obtained Diagnostic Printouts: Despite refusing service, the second dealership was convinced to provide printed codes from the vehicle. These codes show multiple system errors recorded at a very low vehicle mileage, including communication failures with the ABS control module, brake system internal failure, and CAN bus errors. These indicate potential electronic or computer system faults that could have occurred immediately before or during the brake failure.  Manufacturer Warranty Issue: Immediately after the incident, Jeep opened a warranty case #93917003 for the vehicle. However, during subsequent communication, I was informed that this brand-new vehicle has no manufacturer's warranty at all. This is extremely concerning, as the vehicle was purchased new with only minimal mileage and no prior damage or modifications.  Vehicle Condition: The vehicle remains undrivable and unsafe to operate. Jeep or its authorized dealers have performed no corrective action.  Given that this was a brand-new vehicle with extremely low mileage purchased solely for personal family travel, and that both authorized dealerships have refused to address a major safety defect, I am requesting that NHTSA treat this as an urgent safety matter. The refusal to investigate by Jeep dealerships, combined with the unexpected claim that there is no manufacturer warranty, leaves this defect unresolved and poses an ongoing safety risk if similar failures occur in other vehicles."

The distance to the vehicle ahead was more than two car lengths. The brake pedal was fully depressed, but the vehicle did not decelerate adequately to come to a complete stop. The driver's record is clear of any car accident All forward collision warning alerts were sounding, but the ABS and automatic emergency braking (AEB) did not activate. There was no tire screech or pulsation from the brakes. The vehicle slowed but continued to move forward, resulting in a low-speed frontal collision. After the collision, the vehicle refused to move until the engine had been turned off for several minutes. Airbags did not deploy. This incident happened on a brand-new vehicle with only 318 miles on the odometer. We immediately contacted Jeep Corporate and opened a safety case. However, the first authorized dealer we visited, as was told by the Jeep advisor at 111 58th St., Brooklyn, NY 11220, refused to inspect the brake, ABS, or AEB systems under warranty, after we said that we have case number from Jeep and we need to read the computer while it still has information about the acident in the memory. Also were refused to provide a written denial, and directed us to a collision center instead, which repairs only the body but doesn't have equipment to read the car's faults. Due to this refusal, Jeep Corporate initially closed our case without resolution or notification; we had to insist on having it reopened, as the issue wasn't investigated. We are aware that Jeep models from 2024–2025 (though not exactly this trim) have had recalls for ABS, brake module, and electronic stability control issues, and these systems share similar or identical computer modules across model lines. Given these known issues and the seriousness of a complete brake system failure on a new vehicle, I believe this warrants immediate investigation by NHTSA."

It wasn’t until I got the manufacturer involved that they’ve actually kept the vehicle and are apparently doing things… we’ll see.  My reason for contacting is because I have driven a number of their loaner vehicles which were also grand Cherokee And at least half of them I was experiencing the same thing as I was in my own that seems to me like an issue…. the loaner I am currently driving I’m going to have them pick up with a tow truck because I don’t feel safe driving. It has not even half the miles on it than mine does and it’s worse than mine… to me that presents a problem. There are also weird electrical issues. The key fob doesn’t always let me in the door. I have to do it manually. It’s not communicating with the car. The gearshift just all of a sudden locks up and dash reads to put it in Park before I can put it into gear to proceed further.

In each case, I encountered a complete battery failure within the first 3,000 miles of the car’s life. These failures have not only rendered the vehicles completely inoperable but have completely shut down all functionality while driving, leaving me stranded on the road an outright dangerous design flaw with zero warning or alert of malfunction.  At first, I considered the possibility of coincidence or simple bad luck. Now, it is evident this is a systemic and known issue that Stellantis/Jeep has failed to address. It is absolutely unacceptable that a brand-new Jeep product could exhibit such a fundamental reliability defect, and even more troubling that no proactive support or acknowledgment has been provided to affected consumers like myself.  This is disgraceful, inexcusable, and beneath the standards expected of any automaker, let alone one that charges a premium for its products.

It feels like you’re pulling a trailer, but you’re not as the best way I can describe it. This has been going on since about. I don’t know week five or six after buying the vehicle as I’ve stated I’ve taken it in multiple times. It wasn’t until I got the manufacturer involved that they’ve actually kept the vehicle and are apparently doing things… we’ll see.  My reason for contacting is because I have driven a number of their loaner vehicles which were also grand Cherokee And at least half of them I was experiencing the same thing as I was in my own that seems to me like an issue…. the loaner I am currently driving I’m going to have them pick up with a tow truck because I don’t feel safe driving. It has not even half the miles on it than mine does and it’s worse than mine… to me that presents a problem. There are also weird electrical issues. The key fob doesn’t always let me in the door. I have to do it manually. It’s not communicating with the car. The gearshift just all of a sudden locks up and dash reads to put it in Park before I can put it into gear to proceed further. Sometimes the liftgate will not close. I have to do it manually and then it’ll catch the latch and pull down. I do feel there’s a safety is xxx"

In each case, I encountered a complete battery failure within the first 3,000 miles of the car’s life. These failures have not only rendered the vehicles completely inoperable but have completely shut down all functionality while driving, leaving me stranded on the road an outright dangerous design flaw with zero warning or alert of malfunction.  At first, I considered the possibility of coincidence or simple bad luck. Now, it is evident this is a systemic and known issue that Stellantis/Jeep has failed to address. It is absolutely unacceptable that a brand-new Jeep product could exhibit such a fundamental reliability defect, and even more troubling that no proactive support or acknowledgment has been provided to affected consumers like myself.  This is disgraceful, inexcusable, and beneath the standards expected of any automaker, let alone one that charges a premium for its products. This situation also raises serious questions about the strategic direction the company may have taken under their former CEO, Carlos Tavares, whose well-documented focus on near-term cost-cutting and margin improvements appears to be manifesting in subpar quality control and dangerous engineering compromises.

Option B:  A complete refund of the original purchase price of the motorcycle, including all dealer fees and taxes, while allowing me to retain title and possession of the bike given the substantial non-recoverable investment in modifications made in good faith."" I have requested they confirm a resolution by July 10th and, according to '49 CFR Part 573', and whereby the NHTSA interprets 'reasonable timeframe' as 60 days, that the remedy is completed by Aug 5th, 25."

Been riding and getting use to the bike.(absolutely love it) Got my 1st service done after break-in period just to see rumors of a possible recall on social media a week  later.  This was late May early June. Today is June 20th and i am just now receiving an Official notice from Kawasaki about the issue that’s been floating around for months. Very disappointed that i can’t ride the Bike and that im still stuck having to pay on the bike even though it’s currently in the DNR stage. Also there is no know possible fix. 1% of the 17.7k units are affected. Which if you do the math that’s roughly around 170-180 bikes. I would feel somewhat better if they could at least narrow it down to the VIN of the bikes that’s truly affected so that the ones who aren’t can enjoy the Bike they purchased. Kawasaki please handle this swiftly

I am reporting a potentially dangerous engine defect related to the crankshaft bushing or internal bottom-end components.  I have received credible information indicating that this model may suffer from premature crankshaft bushing failure, which can lead to catastrophic engine failure while riding. This poses an extreme safety risk to the rider, especially if it occurs at high speeds.  I contacted a Kawasaki dealer, but they told me there are no active recall or service bulletins from Kawasaki regarding this issue. As a result, I cannot get the motorcycle inspected or repaired, and I am currently unable to ride it due to safety concerns.  To make matters worse, it has come to my attention that Kawasaki has recently halted the sale of the 2025 ZX-6R in the U.S. market, which further suggests that there may be a serious defect the manufacturer is withholding from the public.  I request that NHTSA investigate this matter and determine whether a safety recall is warranted before any serious injuries or fatalities occur. This issue affects not just mechanical integrity but rider safety at its core.  Please advise on the next steps and acknowledge this report as soon as possible.

I was told by the dealership that the bike should not be ridden due to the severity of the issue.  Since then, I have contacted the dealership three times. They have not provided a timeline for repair, no parts are available, and they offered no remedy — other than trying to upsell me another bike for $3,000 more. The motorcycle is not rideable, and I am essentially left with a useless vehicle and no resolution.

I believe this failure is directly related to the USK tie rod ends, which are associated with two known open recalls concerning USK ball studs.  At the time of the incident, no early warning indicators or mechanical symptoms were present to suggest imminent failure. Without warning, the vehicle veered sharply to the left, causing a complete loss of control. The truck subsequently rolled over multiple times, resulting in a serious multi-unit accident that blocked the highway. My drive truck, along with two additional trucks I was transporting, were all involved in the crash.  I was entrapped inside the tractor cab and had to be extricated by emergency responders. I sustained significant injuries, including nerve damage and multiple cervical spine injuries, due to the violent nature of the rollover.  After the incident, I observed indications that the vehicle may have been tampered with. I am uncertain about the current location of the vehicle or the whereabouts of critical front-end components. However, photographic evidence shows that the ball studs were removed post-accident. It is my belief that Paccar is not fully disclosing accurate information related to this incident and the condition of the steering components.  This incident raises serious concerns regarding the vehicle’s safety and the handling of related recall information.

In addition, the sunroof does not open or close properly, and while Kia acknowledged the defect, they only offered a potential software adjustment that does not address the root cause. The vehicle also makes loud, unpredictable popping noises from the dashboard, a problem that multiple other Kia owners at the same dealership have reported. The dealer confirmed that Kia does not have a fix and only offered to temporarily “push in the dashboard.” Furthermore, the seat cooling system has stopped working entirely without repair options provided. These defects compromise the safety and reliability of the vehicle, creating risks of reduced visibility, potential structural failure, and driver distraction. All issues have been reported and documented at Courtesy Kia of Brandon, FL, and confirmed by the dealer, but Kia has failed to provide adequate remedies. No warning lights or error messages appeared prior to these failures. I have also filed reports with the Better Business Bureau Auto Line, the Florida Attorney General’s Office, and Kia Customer Care, but no meaningful resolution has been provided. These ongoing unresolved defects indicate systemic safety issues with the Kia K4."

The first day driving I went up near dodgers stadium , immediately had a burnt smell. I disregarded it thinking maybe its fresh paint burning , WRONG. Till this day 4 months later my tail pipe throws a musty smell. Issue number 2 , the hesitant gas pedal. Who knows what it is maybe fuel system , transmission but daily and I mean DAILY my accelaration is poor,jerky, struggling and overall doesn't work. It has its good mornings but once I'm on the road for more than 10 minutes its back to the struggle. I've had my K4 serviced twice at Dtla service, they never once test drove the car because I was tracking the GPS almost all day for the three days they had it. Once I got my car back it tooks about 45 minutes the service advisor Jeffery Montoya was so lost on where my car was, I had to ask and ask and ask finally the guys who are out front welcoming you helped me and brought my car. That was my decision to never go back to DTLA service. Next took it to Van Nuys Kia waited to weeks from my appointment because they are moving. Finally they kept it for three days they still werent able to diagnose the issue and repair it. Modesto the advisor there said "" we can't duplicate the issue''. Some how they made me pay $82 because they supposedly found plastic bags stuck to my exhuast. [XXX] I even told him I don't want it cleaned and he said oh well you authorized the diag so you have to. He reported that info to kia Corp which got my case closed and said the car works fine. NO it does not work fine. Never going. Now today [XXX] I was parking arriving somewhere the k4 said engine off shift to P while ringing the alarm from the dash. I have it on film. Second driving down [XXX]  and boom car engine shuts off while car are behind me. I had to shift to p then turn the car off. Turned it back on while getting honked at and that was that. $700 a month for a lack of urgency to help me. Boo Kia.

The driver that was behind the contact's vehicle sustained significant bleeding from the forehead, back, and neck pain, and abrasions on the neck, arms, legs, and other parts of the body. The driver's vehicle was significantly damaged. The other driver whose vehicle was crashed into was an older individual, who sustained a broken arm, broken neck and collar bone, abrasions on the facial area, injured back, and a broken nose. The driver's vehicle was totaled. Both drivers were transported to the hospital by ambulance. No further information was provided. A police report was filed, but the contact did not have the police report information available. The vehicle was towed to a second dealer, Kia Delray(2255 S Federal Hwy, Delray Beach, FL 33483), where it was determined that the pulley and the tensioner had detached. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and several cases were opened, but no further assistance was provided. The failure mileage was approximately 2,230."

Unfortunately, my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare.  In December 2024, just one month after purchase, the vehicle completely died while I was driving on the highway—a terrifying and unacceptable failure for a brand-new car. The vehicle was towed to the dealership, where it has remained ever since.  What has made this experience even worse is Range Rover’s appalling customer service. The company’s “repurchasing” agreement process, which I initiated nearly two months ago, is lengthy, convoluted, and appears designed to disadvantage the customer at every step. Despite repeated attempts to get answers, there has been no clear timeline for resolution, no updates from anyone with decision-making authority, and absolutely no way to escalate the matter to management.  For a vehicle in this price range, I expected premium customer care, but what I’ve received is the opposite: silence, frustration, and the sense that Range Rover cares more about protecting itself than making things right for its customers.  Until Range Rover makes significant improvements to the reliability of its vehicles and its customer service, I cannot recommend this brand to anyone. Buyers beware—you may end up with a luxury-priced lemon and no way to resolve it."

The car had no visible damage, and I asked to keep the part for independent analysis but was denied—despite offering to pay in full.  Photos show the vehicle in flawless condition. Lexus initially refused warranty coverage and claimed a front tire may have kicked up a rock, despite all tires being behind the grille. Eventually, after repeated contact with Lexus corporate and both dealerships (in Jacksonville and Clearwater), they agreed to cover the repair—but still refused to return the damaged part.  Several service advisors admitted this issue is common. The condenser appears unprotected behind the grille, making it vulnerable to debris. Given the low mileage and lack of damage, this points to a design flaw. Lexus’s inconsistent handling and denial of access to the part raise concerns.  Request for Investigation Please investigate this as a potential systemic design defect. The vulnerability of the AC condenser can lead to repeat failures and high repair costs, especially in hot climates where AC is essential.

Instead of replacing the bracket or steering wheel assembly, the technician applied “sound dampening tape” to eliminate movement and reinstalled the original parts.  This raises serious concerns about compliance with FMVSS 208, which governs airbag performance and crash safety. A loose or shifting airbag bracket could compromise airbag deployment direction or timing. The use of adhesive tape to correct physical bracket play in a federally regulated safety system appears to be a non-standard and potentially non-compliant repair method.

Lane splitting motorcycles are able to go slightly faster than that, at around 30 to 40 mph. When Elaine's splitting motorcycle passes between my car and the next one over, the drive assist feature gets confused as the motorcycle moves further away from the front of the car. The drive assist feature thinks that traffic has cleared, and the car begins to lunch forward at a high speed.

I immediately notified Lucid, but the company did not attempt a repair or suggest measures to address the issue.  Instead, the company said that I was on my own and stopped responding.  I suspect that the issue is rooted in the high- or low-frequency sounds that the EV makes, but I don't know for certain.

I brought the vehicle to Lucid’s Tysons, VA service center due to a thumping sensation in the steering wheel while turning. On [XXX] Lucid diagnosed the issue as internal play in the bracket that mounts the driver airbag. Instead of replacing the bracket or steering wheel assembly, the technician applied “sound dampening tape” to eliminate movement and reinstalled the original parts.  This raises serious concerns about compliance with FMVSS 208, which governs airbag performance and crash safety. A loose or shifting airbag bracket could compromise airbag deployment direction or timing. The use of adhesive tape to correct physical bracket play in a federally regulated safety system appears to be a non-standard and potentially non-compliant repair method.  Lucid has provided no documentation confirming that this repair method was approved by their engineering team or validated against crashworthiness standards. As a consumer, I am concerned about the long-term integrity of the Supplemental Restraint System and the potential risk of injury in a collision. I am requesting that NHTSA investigate whether this type of repair complies with federal safety requirements.

I purchased the vehicle on February 15, 2025, and it currently has approximately 1,100 miles on it. Since acquiring the vehicle, I have experienced a persistent and extremely loud squeaking noise from the brakes, which occurs spontaneously. At times, the squeaking is so loud that pedestrians turn to look when I drive by.  In an effort to address this issue, I took the vehicle to Royal Palm Beach Mazda for inspection. The service department informed me that this is a known issue with this model and that Mazda has not yet identified a solution. They stated that there was nothing they could do at this time to fix the problem. Additionally, while I was at the dealership, I encountered another Mazda CX-90 owner who was experiencing the same issue.  Concerned about the safety of my vehicle, I reached out to Mazda Headquarters, but I was again told that there is not much that can be done. This response is deeply troubling. I purchased a brand-new vehicle expecting a reliable and safe driving experience. Now, I am left questioning whether my brakes are safe and whether this issue will worsen over time. I am particularly concerned about whether the brakes will function properly when I need to stop in an emergency.  Given that this appears to be a widespread issue affecting multiple vehicles, Mazda should take responsibility by either issuing a recall or offering to repurchase the vehicle. Driving a brand-new car with a potential brake defect is unacceptable and possibly dangerous.  I look forward to your prompt response and a satisfactory resolution to this matter.

My chief complaints are deleting the lighting on the liftgate and not having the full lighting on the headlights. They are replaced with non functional dummy lights. That’s a safety hazard on such a large vehicle. Another feature I was unaware that I did not have was tilting side mirrors. Top trim of inline 6 has it. PHEV does not. Something is not adding up here and the amount of features missing on the top trim is aggravating especially when you consider the cost of the vehicles side by side and what you sacrifice to have PHEV vs inline 6. There are so many complaints about this car not having the same features as its gas counterpart. I took my car to the dealership on two separate occasions for these complaints because I thought they were defects. What also irritates me is that the PHEV is not even worth charging because you only get 27 miles of electric range. It does not last 27 miles though.

This issue has to do with the  vehicle software calling for the camera system to calibrate itself each time it is driven.  The issue arises from the fact that the parameters needed to calibrate the camera system are not met as part of a normal driving pattern.  The vehicle needs to be driven in a straight line for approximately a quarter mile.  The process resets if the wheel is turned more than 10 degrees or the speed exceeds 18mph.  As a consequence the rear camera is stuck in and endless cycle of extending itself and retracting throughout a commute.  The constant noise coming from the rear of the car at irregular intervals distracts drivers and a passengers leading to dangerous driving conditions.  Furthermore attempting to complete the calibration process ie driving a quarter mile at a speed of less than 18mph puts the driver and others on the road in a dangerous condition that will likely lead to rear end collisions at some point.

I am now facing an unacceptable situation that not only violates my consumer rights but has repeatedly placed my personal safety in jeopardy.  After significant issues with my original 2024 vehicle, I was provided a replacement, which I took delivery of on October 15, 2024. Unfortunately, within two weeks, the replacement vehicle was already back in the shop for repairs. It has since required service again on December 24, December 31, and most recently, May 28, 2025. On one particularly alarming occasion, the vehicle shut off in the middle of the road, creating an extremely hazardous and life-threatening situation.  I am driving a vehicle that cost over $60,000, yet it has proven consistently unreliable, unsafe, and unfit for normal operation. This experience has severely tarnished my perception of the Mercedes-Benz brand and has caused undue stress, inconvenience, and concern for my safety.  Given the repeated repair attempts, persistent mechanical failures, and safety issues, I am requesting that Mercedes-Benz fully release me from this lease agreement without penalty or further financial obligation.  Additionally, I am in the process of reviewing whether this situation meets the criteria under [Your State’s] Lemon Law, which typically applies when a vehicle undergoes multiple unsuccessful repair attempts for the same issue or is out of service for an extended period within the first 12-24 months of ownership. Based on the timeline and history of service visits, I believe my situation may qualify."

I, his father, was standing right next to the rear door.  The door does not close all the way because his fingers were in between the two doors.  Then the soft close pulls the door closed crushing his fingers.  To make it worse, I try to open the door but the system prevented me from opening it until the door was closed all the way.  It crushed three fingers causing lacerations on both sides of two fingers.  This would not have happened but for the soft close feature pulling the door shut then preventing me from opening the door.  I tried successfully to replace the issue of the door not opening until it closed all the way; each time the door prevents me from manually releasing it until it is fully closed.

I called Schomp Mini the dealership, [XXX]  who used to be the general manager said: ""Call the insurance company, this sounds like it's not a mechanical defect since it is an outside event.""  I called Geico.  Geico said ""If there is no damage on the bumper, then we consider it a manufacturing fault, and the dealer has to pay for it.""  I then later called Mini USA again, I was transferred to a head technician, who said ""Oh, yeah, That warning isn't telling you that the restraint system is broken, it's telling you the forward sensor is.  There is no protective barrier between the sensor and the bumper, so it can easily get broken without any damage to the outside of the car.  It would be a manufacturing issue.  Call the Service Manager at the Dealer to take care of it.""

There was no evidence of vandalism, collision, or falling objects, and the vehicle was stationary at the time. The glass shattered entirely, leaving shards throughout the interior cargo area and rendering the vehicle unsafe to drive or leave unattended.  When the glass initially broke, there was no glass that fell inward or outward — it appeared to be a slow cracking failure, where the entire pane began breaking down gradually. I approached the vehicle to investigate and opened the rear door to get a better look. As soon as I opened the door, the natural movement and vibration from the door caused the already-shattered glass to collapse inward, which is what you see in the attached photos.  Unfortunately, this makes it appear as if there was an impact from the outside, when in fact the glass was already fractured prior to any physical contact or movement.  Immediately after the incident, I took the vehicle to a certified Nissan dealership for inspection. The dealer reviewed the damage but was unable to identify any clear cause or impact point, nor did they confirm a manufacturer defect. Regardless, I documented the incident extensively with photographs and obtained a formal service report.  To protect the vehicle from weather exposure and theft, I am proceeding with a rear glass replacement. I am submitting this report to NHTSA because I believe this to be a spontaneous failure of the rear window glass that may indicate a broader issue with the manufacturing or installation of this component. If other drivers experience this failure — especially while the vehicle is in motion — it could pose a serious safety risk to passengers.  I respectfully request that this issue be formally investigated. I am also pursuing reimbursement through Nissan Consumer Affairs."

There was no evidence of vandalism, collision, or falling objects, and the vehicle was stationary at the time. The glass shattered entirely, leaving shards throughout the interior cargo area and rendering the vehicle unsafe to drive or leave unattended.  When the glass initially broke, there was no glass that fell inward or outward — it appeared to be a slow cracking failure, where the entire pane began breaking down gradually. I approached the vehicle to investigate and opened the rear door to get a better look. As soon as I opened the door, the natural movement and vibration from the door caused the already-shattered glass to collapse inward, which is what you see in the attached photos.  Unfortunately, this makes it appear as if there was an impact from the outside, when in fact the glass was already fractured prior to any physical contact or movement.  Immediately after the incident, I took the vehicle to a certified Nissan dealership for inspection. The dealer reviewed the damage but was unable to identify any clear cause or impact point, nor did they confirm a manufacturer defect. Regardless, I documented the incident extensively with photographs and obtained a formal service report.  To protect the vehicle from weather exposure and theft, I am proceeding with a rear glass replacement. I am submitting this report to NHTSA because I believe this to be a spontaneous failure of the rear window glass that may indicate a broader issue with the manufacturing or installation of this component. If other drivers experience this failure — especially while the vehicle is in motion — it could pose a serious safety risk to passengers.  I respectfully request that this issue be formally investigated. I am also pursuing reimbursement through Nissan Consumer Affairs."

In my case, the A/C began malfunctioning just one month after I received the vehicle. The system frequently fails to cool, blows warm air, or cycles inconsistently — even in extreme heat. This creates a safety and comfort risk, particularly in regions with high summer temperatures. While Polestar has pushed multiple software updates that claim to improve HVAC performance, none have resolved the issue.  This is only one of several problems I’ve experienced with the vehicle. There has been a litany of other issues, including software instability, unreliable app connectivity, and system behavior that seems inconsistent with expected performance for a new vehicle. However, the A/C failure remains the most significant and dangerous problem.  What’s more troubling is Polestar’s lack of responsiveness. I have attempted to resolve this through customer service and even escalated the matter to their legal department. I’ve received no reply.  Most recently, I attempted to have my vehicle towed to the Costa Mesa, California service center using Polestar Roadside Assistance. Despite repeated efforts, I was unable to reach anyone at the service center to coordinate the tow. I was left stranded with no resolution or support.  I have now exhausted all reasonable avenues with the manufacturer. Given the combination of a critical HVAC failure, unresponsiveness from the manufacturer, and what appears to be a broader trend among other owners, I urge NHTSA to investigate whether this issue warrants a safety recall or broader intervention.  I am happy to provide documentation, including my VIN, service history, and records of my communications, upon request.

The vehicle is undrivable for me now, and, worse, the sensation of pressure hasn't completely gone away even though I haven't driven the vehicle in weeks.

This extended delay means we must continue driving a vehicle without critical safety systems or park it indefinitely, creating both a financial and safety burden. The loss of these features greatly increases the risk of collisions, especially in bad weather or on highways where adaptive cruise, lane departure warnings, and blind spot detection are essential. Online searches show this is not an isolated issue but a recurring problem in 2025 RAM 1500 models, suggesting a broader manufacturing or design defect."

The brakes were in fact almost completely deactivated. It took me over 100 feet to come to a stop. The brake pedal had slightly retracted also causing more issue in trying to reach the brake pedal. Once stopped, I checked the VIN and discovered this recall for the vehicle. The major complaint comes from the recall repair process with Ram/MOPAR. I took the truck to my nearest Ram dealership. Once in, they advised I needed two sensors replaced in the front wheel-well per the recall guidelines. The service department of the dealership further stated they could only order ONE sensor per month per dealership. Not per vehicle, per person, etc. They could as a dealership only order one sensor a month, meaning nobody else could come in for this recall repair while my FIRST sensor was being replaced. Now I am stuck waiting over a month for the second sensor to be ordered. They refused to give me a courtesy vehicle to drive for the time being so I am forced to drive my Ram with this recall issue with a major safety concern.

My previous 2022 RAM’s TBC is incompatible with 2025 due to CAN-bus/electrical changes—this was not disclosed at purchase. • On April 3rd 2025, Mopar support incorrectly told me to buy PN 82219232AA. I later found I needed 82219240AB, which I ordered. Delivery was repeatedly delayed, then canceled in May with no alternative offered. • Opened Case [XXX] with RAM Customer Care on June 10th 2025—no resolution since. • I confirmed my truck is pre-wired with harness 68601443AA and only needs module PN 68569520AB and dash switch PN 68618899AA. I sourced these and scheduled install at Serra Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM for July 28th 2025. Initially told they could do it, but upon arrival, they refused, claiming it must be done at the factory. This is incorrect. Mopar document 82219232AB  [XXX] ) provides dealers official instructions to install/activate the TBC, especially when the truck already has the factory wiring. Safety risk: I used a CURT Bluetooth brake controller as a temporary fix. It frequently loses connection, making it unsafe during sway, high winds, or oscillations. If it fails mid-trip, I lose trailer-only braking. Request: 1.Immediate coordination to install/activate the OEM TBC (Sales Code XHC + proxy alignment). 2.If not feasible, replace the vehicle with one having a factory TBC at no cost to me.

Safety Concern A rebooting cluster distracts the driver, removes access to critical information (speedometer, warning lights), and falsifies odometer readings—potentially masking future maintenance intervals and impairing resale/title accuracy.

I called my salesman and he recommended that I try to “reset” the vehicle by stepping away from the vehicle so it cannot link with the FAB for 10-15 minutes.  I did so and came back.  The truck started fine but it was shaking while idling.  There was no difference driving the truck after the “reset”.  It would still shake severely when the gas pedal was pressed.  We also discovered that the ring around the Start/Stop button was loose.    A tow truck to picked up this vehicle on the same day it was purchased and towed it back to the dealership.  The dealer had the truck from Saturday, June14, 2025 and they returned it on Wednesday, June 18, 2025, stating there was a ""circuit pin"" that was broken.  The very next day on Thursday, June 19, 2025, the check engine light came on.  Pressing the brake pedal made an odd sound, like bubbles or a gargling noise, even while idling.  This noise was not there before.  While driving the vehicle, the shaking was very mild but the truck shifted hard.  Once, when I was accelerating, there was a loud “pop” that occurred in the truck.  Immediately, the dash displayed “See User Manual for Proper Oil and Fuel” and it never went off. After the pop, the truck had a very hard time increasing speed.  When I drove off from a stop sign or after I was stopped at a traffic light, the engine would rev high, 3000 – 5000 RPM, and the truck would not move for a few seconds.  Then it would very slowly increase speed."

Summary of Safety Incidents: First Incident: While driving at approximately 35 mph, the vehicle abruptly and uncommandedly stopped, with no driver input. Fortunately, there were no vehicles behind me at the time, or this could have resulted in a high-speed rear-end collision.  Second Incident: Roughly 400 miles later, while stopped at a traffic light, the vehicle displayed multiple warning alerts and shut itself off completely. Upon restarting and driving approximately 50 yards, the braking system failed for about five seconds, rendering the truck unable to stop. This failure was later replicated by the authorized dealership’s service team, who then informed me that the vehicle’s CPU had failed during repair attempts.  The vehicle has now been out of service for over 50 days, and the dealer has returned it to me twice in an unsafe condition.

I thought it was an alignment issue so i took it to the dealer for an alignment, they adjusted one parameter then gave me the alignment report showing that it's all fine. When i complained it still pulls to the right they took it in for a second service. That service the ""reprogrammed the steering module"" which is different from the prior model year. This made zero difference and the car still pulls to the right. It is annoying below 60 MPH where it essentially nudges you to the right and dangerous above 70MPH. I am in Texas and we have a local toll road with an 80MPH speed limit so the speeds i described are an everyday travel situation here, not speeding or being reckless.   If i drive holding the wheel straight with one hand for example on a perfectly straight piece of road and let go of the wheel for less than a second to reposition my hand the car veers to the right.

As I was turning into a parking lot to get somewhere safe the power to the truck turned off, and I lost power steering. Truck came to a stop in a parking but I was blocking traffic. Tow truck driver was able to jump the battery to get it onto a tow truck.  I had the vehicle towed back to the dealer. They scanned the truck, and there were alot of codes thrown. They have been talking to Stellantis Engineers to figure out the problem. I was told by dealer that for certain it is a broken wire causing the batteries not to charge. That wasn't it. I am now being told it is the battery control module, and they have ordered parts. I have checked ram forums, and there are a lot of people reporting similar issues of brand new trucks dying within a few hundred miles of purchasing. replacing the batteries, and alternators. However, the truck dies again shortly after."

However, the manufacturer (FCA US LLC/Stellantis) has failed to supply the replacement windshield, rendering my vehicle undrivable for an extended period due to their inadequate parts supply chain. This delay creates a major safety risk because the vehicle cannot be driven legally or safely without a windshield. In emergency situations, the vehicle would be unusable, and I have incurred significant financial harm due to its inoperability. A new vehicle should not have months-long delays for critical safety components. The OEM supplier (Carlex) has confirmed that the windshield is in stock and available to ship, meaning the issue is due entirely to FCA's failure to place the order or manage their supply chain. This demonstrates negligence in FCA/Stellantis' parts supply chain, impacting customers who require essential repairs. This issue is not an isolated incident but rather a symptom of FCA's failure to ensure part availability for new vehicles. A consumer should not have to wait months to obtain a necessary safety component for a brand-new vehicle. I request that NHTSA investigate FCA/Stellantis' failure to supply essential replacement parts in a reasonable timeframe as this represents a potentially systemic issue affecting vehicle owners."

Then soon after, my check engine light came on.  I took it to a dealership for warranty repair.  Their code scanner revealed several misfire codes along with other related codes.  This issue seems to be very common for the 2025 RAM with the new twin turbo 6-cylinder engine as noted by many people in online vehicle groups for this truck that have same experience. RAM has acknowledged the issue but doesn’t have a fix in almost 6 months later. My truck has been in service at the dealership for over 40 days and I have made several calls to check the status.  Each time they say they cannot resolve. They say they have been in contact with the manufacturers “tech line” and have followed all their recommendations, but nothing has worked and there are no other resolutions available. There is nothing they can do. Due to the misfire code and the check engine light is on, the truck cannot be used safely on the road due to erratic performance.  Sometimes on the highway, maximum speed will drop to 40 mph.  Misfire codes also present a problem with potential engine damage. Also, I am obviously worried about my state SAFETY inspection that is due in another 6 months that would certainly fail leaving me unable to legally operate the vehicle.  Since this seems to be a mysterious issue that Stellantis/RAM is unable to understand, much less repair, I am worried about potential long-term issues with this truck.

Beginning with the 2025 model, RAM changed it's policy of providing one paper copy of the RAM 1500 Owner's Manual to the original owner upon request.

To access the Owner's Manual in my truck, I must download the RAM app on my Smartphone and maintain a good internet connection -- the RAM app will not open without a good internet connection.

The brakes were in fact almost completely deactivated. It took me over 100 feet to come to a stop. The brake pedal had slightly retracted also causing more issue in trying to reach the brake pedal. Once stopped, I checked the VIN and discovered this recall for the vehicle. The major complaint comes from the recall repair process with Ram/MOPAR. I took the truck to my nearest Ram dealership. Once in, they advised I needed two sensors replaced in the front wheel-well per the recall guidelines. The service department of the dealership further stated they could only order ONE sensor per month per dealership. Not per vehicle, per person, etc. They could as a dealership only order one sensor a month, meaning nobody else could come in for this recall repair while my FIRST sensor was being replaced. Now I am stuck waiting over a month for the second sensor to be ordered.

I sourced these and scheduled install at Serra Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM for July 28th 2025. Initially told they could do it, but upon arrival, they refused, claiming it must be done at the factory.

Every restart forces the odometer to reset and display 40 miles, erasing the accurate accumulated mileage. Simultaneously, the vehicle fails to retain any infotainment or vehicle-settings data (radio presets, climate preferences, drive modes, seat/mirror memory). This occurs 100 % of the time with every ignition cycle and has happened on every drive since purchase.  Safety Concern A rebooting cluster distracts the driver, removes access to critical information (speedometer, warning lights), and falsifies odometer readings—potentially masking future maintenance intervals and impairing resale/title accuracy. The loss of settings can also disable previously selected safety aids (e.g., adaptive cruise presets, lane-keep parameters) without the driver’s knowledge.  Attempts to Resolve  Hard battery reset performed (negative-terminal disconnect, 30 min). Issue returned on first restart.  Awaiting dealer appointment; preliminary research indicates similar complaints among early-production 2025 RHO vehicles and a possible IPC/BCM firmware defect.

A few miles from home, the truck began to shake violently when the gas pedal was pressed.  The engine or transmission light was on.  The faster the truck went, the harder it would shake.  The shaking stopped when there was no pressure on the gas pedal.  The shaking was so severe that it was very difficult to drive over 30 mph.

We also discovered that the ring around the Start/Stop button was loose.    A tow truck to picked up this vehicle on the same day it was purchased and towed it back to the dealership.

This noise was not there before.  While driving the vehicle, the shaking was very mild but the truck shifted hard.  Once, when I was accelerating, there was a loud “pop” that occurred in the truck.  Immediately, the dash displayed “See User Manual for Proper Oil and Fuel” and it never went off. After the pop, the truck had a very hard time increasing speed.

I thought it was an alignment issue so i took it to the dealer for an alignment, they adjusted one parameter then gave me the alignment report showing that it's all fine. When i complained it still pulls to the right they took it in for a second service. That service the ""reprogrammed the steering module"" which is different from the prior model year. This made zero difference and the car still pulls to the right. It is annoying below 60 MPH where it essentially nudges you to the right and dangerous above 70MPH. I am in Texas and we have a local toll road with an 80MPH speed limit so the speeds i described are an everyday travel situation here, not speeding or being reckless.   If i drive holding the wheel straight with one hand for example on a perfectly straight piece of road and let go of the wheel for less than a second to reposition my hand the car veers to the right. If i let go for 2 seconds at 65mph it leaves the lane  I was curious how long it would take my other car to leave the lane, i did that experiment on the same road. It took 10 seconds before it even got close to the line. Same stretch of road, similar weather.   This is not weather related. This behavior occurs at all times, various temperatures. In total i have about 1100 miles on the new car.   I think this car needs an urgent mandatory recall and a stop sale.

However, the manufacturer (FCA US LLC/Stellantis) has failed to supply the replacement windshield, rendering my vehicle undrivable for an extended period due to their inadequate parts supply chain. This delay creates a major safety risk because the vehicle cannot be driven legally or safely without a windshield. In emergency situations, the vehicle would be unusable, and I have incurred significant financial harm due to its inoperability. A new vehicle should not have months-long delays for critical safety components. The OEM supplier (Carlex) has confirmed that the windshield is in stock and available to ship, meaning the issue is due entirely to FCA's failure to place the order or manage their supply chain. This demonstrates negligence in FCA/Stellantis' parts supply chain, impacting customers who require essential repairs. This issue is not an isolated incident but rather a symptom of FCA's failure to ensure part availability for new vehicles. A consumer should not have to wait months to obtain a necessary safety component for a brand-new vehicle.

RAM has acknowledged the issue but doesn’t have a fix in almost 6 months later. My truck has been in service at the dealership for over 40 days and I have made several calls to check the status.  Each time they say they cannot resolve. They say they have been in contact with the manufacturers “tech line” and have followed all their recommendations, but nothing has worked and there are no other resolutions available. There is nothing they can do. Due to the misfire code and the check engine light is on, the truck cannot be used safely on the road due to erratic performance.  Sometimes on the highway, maximum speed will drop to 40 mph.  Misfire codes also present a problem with potential engine damage. Also, I am obviously worried about my state SAFETY inspection that is due in another 6 months that would certainly fail leaving me unable to legally operate the vehicle.

On Monday morning i drove it to the dealership and left it there. They did give me a loaner vehicle. 2 days later I got a call from Dave the service manager and he let me know that the ring that fell on my foot holds a brake pedal in place and that they were going to replace the entire brake pedal assembly, the abs module, the brake booster and some ecm (i didn't understand which one). This truck has been unusable now for 7 days and I've only owned it for 13 days. It's been in the shop for 5 days now.

Due to the misfire code and the check engine light is on I cannot use things like my remote vehicle starter or utilize my app that I paid for.  Misfire codes also present a problem with the engine, they can cause engine damage along with a reduction in power. Since the issue started so early in owning the vehicle it is hard to tell if any power reduction issues are present.

The brakes were in fact almost completely deactivated. It took me over 100 feet to come to a stop. The brake pedal had slightly retracted also causing more issue in trying to reach the brake pedal. Once stopped, I checked the VIN and discovered this recall for the vehicle. The major complaint comes from the recall repair process with Ram/MOPAR. I took the truck to my nearest Ram dealership. Once in, they advised I needed two sensors replaced in the front wheel-well per the recall guidelines. The service department of the dealership further stated they could only order ONE sensor per month per dealership. Not per vehicle, per person, etc. They could as a dealership only order one sensor a month, meaning nobody else could come in for this recall repair while my FIRST sensor was being replaced. Now I am stuck waiting over a month for the second sensor to be ordered.

I bought my truck to tow a travel trailer, which I cannot safely do without resolving this. Background: • Purchased 2025 RAM 1500 LARAMIE CREW CAB 4X4 (VIN: [XXX] ) in March 2025. My previous 2022 RAM’s TBC is incompatible with 2025 due to CAN-bus/electrical changes—this was not disclosed at purchase. • On April 3rd 2025, Mopar support incorrectly told me to buy PN 82219232AA. I later found I needed 82219240AB, which I ordered. Delivery was repeatedly delayed, then canceled in May with no alternative offered. • Opened Case [XXX] with RAM Customer Care on June 10th 2025—no resolution since. • I confirmed my truck is pre-wired with harness 68601443AA and only needs module PN 68569520AB and dash switch PN 68618899AA. I sourced these and scheduled install at Serra Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM for July 28th 2025. Initially told they could do it, but upon arrival, they refused, claiming it must be done at the factory. This is incorrect. Mopar document 82219232AB  [XXX] ) provides dealers official instructions to install/activate the TBC, especially when the truck already has the factory wiring. Safety risk: I used a CURT Bluetooth brake controller as a temporary fix. It frequently loses connection, making it unsafe during sway, high winds, or oscillations. If it fails mid-trip, I lose trailer-only braking. Request: 1.Immediate coordination to install/activate the OEM TBC (Sales Code XHC + proxy alignment). 2.If not feasible, replace the vehicle with one having a factory TBC at no cost to me.

Every restart forces the odometer to reset and display 40 miles, erasing the accurate accumulated mileage. Simultaneously, the vehicle fails to retain any infotainment or vehicle-settings data (radio presets, climate preferences, drive modes, seat/mirror memory). This occurs 100 % of the time with every ignition cycle and has happened on every drive since purchase.  Safety Concern A rebooting cluster distracts the driver, removes access to critical information (speedometer, warning lights), and falsifies odometer readings—potentially masking future maintenance intervals and impairing resale/title accuracy. The loss of settings can also disable previously selected safety aids (e.g., adaptive cruise presets, lane-keep parameters) without the driver’s knowledge.  Attempts to Resolve  Hard battery reset performed (negative-terminal disconnect, 30 min). Issue returned on first restart.  Awaiting dealer appointment; preliminary research indicates similar complaints among early-production 2025 RHO vehicles and a possible IPC/BCM firmware defect.

Upon highway driving noticed a severe pull to the right at speed 70 mph. Called dealer to explain the problem and they suggested an alignment that was done on 05/01/2025. Dealer said numbers were green alignment was good. I did highway test again same problem pulling to right. Returned to dealer at 618 miles 05/07/2025 for reset electronic power steering module TSB 08 093 25. Problem still there. At 900 miles and 1500 miles truck was at 2 different dealers for alignments. Problem still there. From what I’ve been told there’s no service bulletin from Ram that addresses problem.This truck is a true disaster waiting to happen. After 52 years of driving I never drove a vehicle this hard to  control.After reading Ram forums about this issue I know I’m not the only driver who has this problem. Just hope this issue is resolved before someone gets seriously injured or worse. Need someone from Stellantis or Ram to investigate this NOW!!

The vehicle has exhibited repeated, dangerous failures of its advanced driver assistance and braking systems that place both the driver and public at serious risk.  Summary of Safety Incidents: First Incident: While driving at approximately 35 mph, the vehicle abruptly and uncommandedly stopped, with no driver input. Fortunately, there were no vehicles behind me at the time, or this could have resulted in a high-speed rear-end collision.  Second Incident: Roughly 400 miles later, while stopped at a traffic light, the vehicle displayed multiple warning alerts and shut itself off completely. Upon restarting and driving approximately 50 yards, the braking system failed for about five seconds, rendering the truck unable to stop. This failure was later replicated by the authorized dealership’s service team, who then informed me that the vehicle’s CPU had failed during repair attempts.  The vehicle has now been out of service for over 50 days, and the dealer has returned it to me twice in an unsafe condition. Stellantis, the vehicle manufacturer, has acknowledged the problem but has not provided a resolution."

I thought it was an alignment issue so i took it to the dealer for an alignment, they adjusted one parameter then gave me the alignment report showing that it's all fine. When i complained it still pulls to the right they took it in for a second service. That service the ""reprogrammed the steering module"" which is different from the prior model year. This made zero difference and the car still pulls to the right. It is annoying below 60 MPH where it essentially nudges you to the right and dangerous above 70MPH. I am in Texas and we have a local toll road with an 80MPH speed limit so the speeds i described are an everyday travel situation here, not speeding or being reckless.   If i drive holding the wheel straight with one hand for example on a perfectly straight piece of road and let go of the wheel for less than a second to reposition my hand the car veers to the right.

So I pulled over into a parking spot turned off the truck and started it back up. The truck started up, but all the lights were still on. I tried to shift into drive but it wouldn't go in gear. I think is because the brake weren't going far enough to push whatever sensor allows the shifter to shift. I tried pumping the brakes and shifting and it worked. So i drove the truck home very carefully and parked it in my driveway. The next morning I called my sales man and left him a msg. He called me later that evening and asked me to bring it in on Monday morning. I did not use the truck during the weekend because it felt very unsafe to drive. On Monday morning i drove it to the dealership and left it there. They did give me a loaner vehicle. 2 days later I got a call from Dave the service manager and he let me know that the ring that fell on my foot holds a brake pedal in place and that they were going to replace the entire brake pedal assembly, the abs module, the brake booster and some ecm (i didn't understand which one).

The brakes were in fact almost completely deactivated. It took me over 100 feet to come to a stop. The brake pedal had slightly retracted also causing more issue in trying to reach the brake pedal. Once stopped, I checked the VIN and discovered this recall for the vehicle. The major complaint comes from the recall repair process with Ram/MOPAR. I took the truck to my nearest Ram dealership. Once in, they advised I needed two sensors replaced in the front wheel-well per the recall guidelines. The service department of the dealership further stated they could only order ONE sensor per month per dealership. Not per vehicle, per person, etc. They could as a dealership only order one sensor a month, meaning nobody else could come in for this recall repair while my FIRST sensor was being replaced. Now I am stuck waiting over a month for the second sensor to be ordered. They refused to give me a courtesy vehicle to drive for the time being so I am forced to drive my Ram with this recall issue with a major safety concern.

My previous 2022 RAM’s TBC is incompatible with 2025 due to CAN-bus/electrical changes—this was not disclosed at purchase. • On April 3rd 2025, Mopar support incorrectly told me to buy PN 82219232AA. I later found I needed 82219240AB, which I ordered. Delivery was repeatedly delayed, then canceled in May with no alternative offered. • Opened Case [XXX] with RAM Customer Care on June 10th 2025—no resolution since. • I confirmed my truck is pre-wired with harness 68601443AA and only needs module PN 68569520AB and dash switch PN 68618899AA. I sourced these and scheduled install at Serra Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM for July 28th 2025. Initially told they could do it, but upon arrival, they refused, claiming it must be done at the factory. This is incorrect. Mopar document 82219232AB  [XXX] ) provides dealers official instructions to install/activate the TBC, especially when the truck already has the factory wiring. Safety risk: I used a CURT Bluetooth brake controller as a temporary fix. It frequently loses connection, making it unsafe during sway, high winds, or oscillations. If it fails mid-trip, I lose trailer-only braking. Request: 1.Immediate coordination to install/activate the OEM TBC (Sales Code XHC + proxy alignment). 2.If not feasible, replace the vehicle with one having a factory TBC at no cost to me.

Safety Concern A rebooting cluster distracts the driver, removes access to critical information (speedometer, warning lights), and falsifies odometer readings—potentially masking future maintenance intervals and impairing resale/title accuracy.

We also discovered that the ring around the Start/Stop button was loose.    A tow truck to picked up this vehicle on the same day it was purchased and towed it back to the dealership.  The dealer had the truck from Saturday, June14, 2025 and they returned it on Wednesday, June 18, 2025, stating there was a ""circuit pin"" that was broken.  The very next day on Thursday, June 19, 2025, the check engine light came on.  Pressing the brake pedal made an odd sound, like bubbles or a gargling noise, even while idling.  This noise was not there before.  While driving the vehicle, the shaking was very mild but the truck shifted hard.  Once, when I was accelerating, there was a loud “pop” that occurred in the truck.  Immediately, the dash displayed “See User Manual for Proper Oil and Fuel” and it never went off. After the pop, the truck had a very hard time increasing speed.  When I drove off from a stop sign or after I was stopped at a traffic light, the engine would rev high, 3000 – 5000 RPM, and the truck would not move for a few seconds.  Then it would very slowly increase speed."

Summary of Safety Incidents: First Incident: While driving at approximately 35 mph, the vehicle abruptly and uncommandedly stopped, with no driver input. Fortunately, there were no vehicles behind me at the time, or this could have resulted in a high-speed rear-end collision.  Second Incident: Roughly 400 miles later, while stopped at a traffic light, the vehicle displayed multiple warning alerts and shut itself off completely. Upon restarting and driving approximately 50 yards, the braking system failed for about five seconds, rendering the truck unable to stop. This failure was later replicated by the authorized dealership’s service team, who then informed me that the vehicle’s CPU had failed during repair attempts.  The vehicle has now been out of service for over 50 days, and the dealer has returned it to me twice in an unsafe condition.

I thought it was an alignment issue so i took it to the dealer for an alignment, they adjusted one parameter then gave me the alignment report showing that it's all fine. When i complained it still pulls to the right they took it in for a second service. That service the ""reprogrammed the steering module"" which is different from the prior model year. This made zero difference and the car still pulls to the right. It is annoying below 60 MPH where it essentially nudges you to the right and dangerous above 70MPH. I am in Texas and we have a local toll road with an 80MPH speed limit so the speeds i described are an everyday travel situation here, not speeding or being reckless.   If i drive holding the wheel straight with one hand for example on a perfectly straight piece of road and let go of the wheel for less than a second to reposition my hand the car veers to the right.

They have been talking to Stellantis Engineers to figure out the problem. I was told by dealer that for certain it is a broken wire causing the batteries not to charge. That wasn't it. I am now being told it is the battery control module, and they have ordered parts. I have checked ram forums, and there are a lot of people reporting similar issues of brand new trucks dying within a few hundred miles of purchasing. replacing the batteries, and alternators.

However, the manufacturer (FCA US LLC/Stellantis) has failed to supply the replacement windshield, rendering my vehicle undrivable for an extended period due to their inadequate parts supply chain. This delay creates a major safety risk because the vehicle cannot be driven legally or safely without a windshield. In emergency situations, the vehicle would be unusable, and I have incurred significant financial harm due to its inoperability. A new vehicle should not have months-long delays for critical safety components. The OEM supplier (Carlex) has confirmed that the windshield is in stock and available to ship, meaning the issue is due entirely to FCA's failure to place the order or manage their supply chain. This demonstrates negligence in FCA/Stellantis' parts supply chain, impacting customers who require essential repairs. This issue is not an isolated incident but rather a symptom of FCA's failure to ensure part availability for new vehicles. A consumer should not have to wait months to obtain a necessary safety component for a brand-new vehicle. I request that NHTSA investigate FCA/Stellantis' failure to supply essential replacement parts in a reasonable timeframe as this represents a potentially systemic issue affecting vehicle owners."

Then soon after, my check engine light came on.  I took it to a dealership for warranty repair.  Their code scanner revealed several misfire codes along with other related codes.  This issue seems to be very common for the 2025 RAM with the new twin turbo 6-cylinder engine as noted by many people in online vehicle groups for this truck that have same experience. RAM has acknowledged the issue but doesn’t have a fix in almost 6 months later. My truck has been in service at the dealership for over 40 days and I have made several calls to check the status.  Each time they say they cannot resolve. They say they have been in contact with the manufacturers “tech line” and have followed all their recommendations, but nothing has worked and there are no other resolutions available. There is nothing they can do. Due to the misfire code and the check engine light is on, the truck cannot be used safely on the road due to erratic performance.  Sometimes on the highway, maximum speed will drop to 40 mph.  Misfire codes also present a problem with potential engine damage. Also, I am obviously worried about my state SAFETY inspection that is due in another 6 months that would certainly fail leaving me unable to legally operate the vehicle.  Since this seems to be a mysterious issue that Stellantis/RAM is unable to understand, much less repair, I am worried about potential long-term issues with this truck.

I manually shut them off and went on my way. Check engine light comes on showing low voltage. Dealership changes battery but says it’s odd to have the misfire codes but doesn’t address it. 3 days later check engine light is on again for multiple codes for misfirings. Take it to the dealer again where it’s been sitting for the last week and a half. I get told today Chrysler has no fix for it and is closing the case and I can pick it up. I’m sorry, what??

This is an attempt to prevent an accident causing injury or vehicle damage when I am operating my truck.  A specific example is to review the instructions to engage the low range 4x4 function without damaging the truck or myself. Beginning with the 2025 model, RAM changed it's policy of providing one paper copy of the RAM 1500 Owner's Manual to the original owner upon request.  As of today, a paper copy of the 2025 RAM 1500 Owner's Manual from RAM is unattainable.  It is only available in an electronic format, and to people with computers and or smartphones with active internet access.  RAM does not provide access to an Owner's Manual for their 2025 RAM 1500 to anyone who doesn't have a computer or smartphone.   To access the Owner's Manual in my truck, I must download the RAM app on my Smartphone and maintain a good internet connection -- the RAM app will not open without a good internet connection.  The other problem with this is that I am now required by RAM to always own a smart phone and purchase an internet service to view my Owner's Manual. I have owned the truck for less than three months with less that 1,000 miles, I have been unable to access my truck's operating instructions from the Owner's Manual at least three times. I have been in contact with RAM at least 4 times requesting a paper copy of the Owner's Manual, and been told they will not provide one. The solution to this problem is to return to their original policy of providing a paper copy upon request, OR add a PDF reading capability in the truck's onboard computer and load the manual into the onboard computer.  Any assistance will be appreciated."

My previous truck was a 2023 Ram 2500 rebel that never had an issue with connecting my boat trailer electrical system. All lights worked as should.  I still have the same boat trailer as previous(2020 shore lander trailer with led lights).

The airbag status indicator reads “Passenger Airbag Off” despite full occupant weight in the seat, presenting a clear safety hazard in the event of a crash.  This issue occurs unpredictably during normal use. The vehicle was first brought to a Rivian Service Center from June 11 to June 14, 2025, and is currently back in service as of June 23, 2025 for the same unresolved problem. However, the Rivian service team has stated they cannot replicate the issue, despite repeated attempts and my documentation of its occurrence.  Safety Risk: Failure of the passenger airbag to activate under proper seating conditions poses a serious risk of injury or death in a collision. This appears to violate FMVSS No. 208 (Occupant Crash Protection) and may stem from a malfunction in the Occupant Detection System (ODS) or associated components.  Request for Action: I urge the NHTSA to investigate this issue as a potential defect affecting the 2025 Rivian R1S platform.

That is too far for a car accident. I was told by the dealership that the alogorithum between speed and object detection is what made the car react that way.

I then started the car heading to my destination. While on the interstate my car kept trying to drag me back into a lane despite me wanting to change lanes.

That is too far for a car accident. I was told by the dealership that the alogorithum between speed and object detection is what made the car react that way. Essentially it calculated that at the speed I was at I would have overtaken the car in front of me despite the fact that it was hundreds of feet away.    This is dangerous and in no way would I have kept that speed and overran that car, besides I was getting back in the other lane to get on the interstate ramp in less than 100 feet.  2) I have small kids, in the morning I unlock the car and load them up into the car while I go back and forth to the house to get the rest of my things. I then started the car heading to my destination. While on the interstate my car kept trying to drag me back into a lane despite me wanting to change lanes. Turns out while I was loading my kids in the car they were searching for their ""Kids Bop"" radio station and hit all sorts of buttons, changing my button selection. I did not know how to change it back without reading the book. I had to pull over to the side of the interstate to google how to change the features. I was late to work and completely stressed out. The buttons shouldn't be that easy to change. And frankly shouldn't exist, they are dangerous.  3) Today I pull into my parking space at work and the bush in front of me is overgrown, the collision detection system detects the leggy limbs of the bush and slams on breaks flashing the collision notice.

I previously owned a 2024 Subaru [same model], which did not have this issue. I have also spoken with other owners of the 2025 model who are not experiencing this problem, so I do not believe this is typical for the vehicle.  Subaru of America sent an engineer to inspect the vehicle, but the evaluation was limited to measuring vibration levels. He did not place the vehicle on a lift or inspect any physical components, such as the suspension, wheels, or drivetrain. Despite this limited assessment, he concluded the vibration was “normal.”  I respectfully disagree with this conclusion, as the vibration significantly affects the drivability, comfort, and confidence I feel while operating the vehicle.

She is not heavy enough to activate the ""airbag on"" light. The dealer inspected the passenger seat and said that the airbag on/off function is working properly and works as expected for persons about 100 pounds or more. They confirmed that the ""airbag on"" light does not come on for my wife. Your website indicates that you have used dummies for airbag deployment for children and small stature women. Is it safer for a small stature woman to have the airbag not deploy in a frontal collision than to deploy? We checked a 2025 Honda CR-V and the ""airbag on"" light is activated when she sits in the front passenger seat. We were given information that a weight of about 65 pounds is required to activate the airbag. Subaru has not told us what weight is required. It seems strange that the airbag activation requirements would vary from on vehicle to another. We are wondering whether it would be safer for us to keep the Subaru vehicle (where the airbag would not deploy) or replace it with the Honda CR-V, for which the airbag would deploy. Does your research indicate which option may be safer?. Subaru Customer Service said the airbag system is operating as it was intended and would not buy the car back. The dealer has offered to buy the car at a reduced price if we want to sell it and replace it with the Honda CR-V. Can you please provide some guidance for us based upon your crash research studies.

The issue happened because the turn signal buttons are not fixed and they rotate along with the rotation of the steering wheel.  It makes us look for the turn signal buttons every time the steering wheel is turned and becomes a safety hazard when in motion. Also, it is very challenging when we have to make a right/left turn while on the ramp to take an exit because the buttons are not fixes unlike the turn signal stalks.

V13.2.8 being the latest customer version. Since the update to FSD V13 in December, I have consistently used it on a daily basis. While it performs great on City streets, it consistently caused a serious safety risk on the freeway:  It habitually tailgates cars at high speeds of 70-80 mph on the freeway. It does this even when there is no traffic and the other lanes are wide open. I have experienced this on both a Model 3 (2025) and a Model Y (2024).   I am writing this complaint here hoping you will pay attention to it, as despite my best efforts, Tesla has ignored my feedback. I even opened a service ticket about it at one point, and the service tech couldn't care less.

I've found that these jam from time to time. What I mean is sometimes when I push the button, it is already 'jammed in' and nothing happens. I have to kind of randomly push around the button a few times, or push the opposite turn signal direction to unjam it.  This causes a few problems:  1) Lane changes are dynamic and accident-prone. Having the signal indicator button jam on me is distracting and that's dangerous. 2) Sometimes the reason I need to change lanes is urgent, to avoid a potential collision ahead of me. If the button jams on me while I'm signaling the lane change, my instinct is to abort the lane change until I figure out what's going on. That's dangerous itself, since I might end up colliding. 3) When I'm trying to unjam it, my turn signals visible to other drivers can be kind of erratic - they sometimes see me signaling the opposite way briefly, or on-and-off.  When I reported the problem to the Tesla service center, they said they've heard about the issue before. They said that usually people will bring in their car, but they won't be able to reproduce the issue onsite so they can't so anything about it. And they suggested that it might be because I'm not being 'precise' with my button presses, causing the buttons to occasionally be wedged. The problem with this is that the buttons don't have clear outlines of where you're supposed to press them, and there's no tactile way to position your thumb in the right spots -- and the position of the buttons is kind of variable since they pivot as the steering wheel itself pivots (unlike turn stalks which remain stationary regardless of the steering wheel angle)."

Deactivation of the turn signals is counter intuitive, pressing the opposite direction does not deactivate them, instead activating the direction pressed. The significant departure from a standard stalk is dangerous.

This became a critical safety hazard multiple times when taking a turn and had to give the turn indication. The issue happened because the turn signal buttons are not fixed and they rotate along with the rotation of the steering wheel.  It makes us look for the turn signal buttons every time the steering wheel is turned and becomes a safety hazard when in motion. Also, it is very challenging when we have to make a right/left turn while on the ramp to take an exit because the buttons are not fixes unlike the turn signal stalks. There were times when we were unable to give the turn signals. It is not only dangerous for the Tesla drivers but also for the other drivers on the road to effectively communicate.

I was parking slowly and cautiously with my foot on the brake at all times. According to a neighbor who witnessed the incident, I was moving at a very slow speed when the vehicle suddenly surged forward without warning.  I did not intend to accelerate, and I firmly believe this may have been the result of a system malfunction—possibly involving the vehicle’s sensors, software, or misinterpretation of pedal input.  Tesla Service reviewed the driving log and stated that it showed I “stepped on the accelerator.” I respectfully dispute this conclusion, as the vehicle’s behavior was completely inconsistent with my actions. I am a careful, experienced driver with no prior accidents in over 30 years of driving.  This incident raises serious concerns about Sudden Unintended Acceleration (SUA), a known issue that has been reported by other Tesla drivers in past years. If the vehicle misinterprets driver input or experiences a sensor/software glitch, this can lead to property damage or bodily injury, especially in tight parking situations or near pedestrians.

I've found that these jam from time to time. What I mean is sometimes when I push the button, it is already 'jammed in' and nothing happens. I have to kind of randomly push around the button a few times, or push the opposite turn signal direction to unjam it.  This causes a few problems:  1) Lane changes are dynamic and accident-prone. Having the signal indicator button jam on me is distracting and that's dangerous. 2) Sometimes the reason I need to change lanes is urgent, to avoid a potential collision ahead of me. If the button jams on me while I'm signaling the lane change, my instinct is to abort the lane change until I figure out what's going on. That's dangerous itself, since I might end up colliding. 3) When I'm trying to unjam it, my turn signals visible to other drivers can be kind of erratic - they sometimes see me signaling the opposite way briefly, or on-and-off.  When I reported the problem to the Tesla service center, they said they've heard about the issue before. They said that usually people will bring in their car, but they won't be able to reproduce the issue onsite so they can't so anything about it. And they suggested that it might be because I'm not being 'precise' with my button presses, causing the buttons to occasionally be wedged. The problem with this is that the buttons don't have clear outlines of where you're supposed to press them, and there's no tactile way to position your thumb in the right spots -- and the position of the buttons is kind of variable since they pivot as the steering wheel itself pivots (unlike turn stalks which remain stationary regardless of the steering wheel angle)."

During a recent road trip with my husband and daughter from Boston, MA to Washington, D.C., I used Tesla's FSD feature. On our return trip on [XXX] while traveling on [XXX] under FSD control, the system demonstrated erratic and dangerous behavior that nearly caused a fatal accident. As we approached an intersection on [XXX] , I observed that the traffic lights were red. However, the vehicle—still under FSD control—continued traveling at approximately 70 mph without slowing down. Sensing something was wrong, I quickly intervened and manually stopped the car at the intersection, where cross traffic was moving at high speeds in both directions. Had I reacted even a second later—or had the lights remained red in our direction—we likely would have been struck and potentially killed by the oncoming traffic. After reviewing dashcam footage from the incident, I confirmed that the FSD system had not only failed to recognize the red traffic signal but had also directed the car onto the wrong path, leading us into the potential path of oncoming vehicles. This serious failure posed an extreme and unacceptable risk to my family’s lives.  Following the incident, my young daughter was deeply traumatized and developed a high fever that night.

During a recent road trip with my husband and daughter from Boston, MA to Washington, D.C., I used Tesla's FSD feature. On our return trip on [XXX] while traveling on [XXX] under FSD control, the system demonstrated erratic and dangerous behavior that nearly caused a fatal accident. As we approached an intersection on [XXX] , I observed that the traffic lights were red. However, the vehicle—still under FSD control—continued traveling at approximately 70 mph without slowing down. Sensing something was wrong, I quickly intervened and manually stopped the car at the intersection, where cross traffic was moving at high speeds in both directions. Had I reacted even a second later—or had the lights remained red in our direction—we likely would have been struck and potentially killed by the oncoming traffic. After reviewing dashcam footage from the incident, I confirmed that the FSD system had not only failed to recognize the red traffic signal but had also directed the car onto the wrong path, leading us into the potential path of oncoming vehicles. This serious failure posed an extreme and unacceptable risk to my family’s lives.  Following the incident, my young daughter was deeply traumatized and developed a high fever that night. This experience has left lasting emotional and psychological distress for all of us. I believe this event highlights a severe and urgent defect in Tesla’s FSD system. I respectfully urge the NHTSA to launch an immediate investigation to prevent similar occurrences that could result in injury or loss of life. I am prepared to submit the dashcam footage and relevant vehicle logs to support this report. Please advise on the next steps for providing this evidence.

The vibration becomes noticeable around 50 mph and increases in severity with speed, making it difficult to clearly see vehicles in the adjacent lane. This issue persists even after mirror replacements or realignments, indicating a possible design or manufacturing defect affecting multiple vehicles.  The vibration affects driver visibility and could pose a significant safety risk, particularly during lane changes or merging maneuvers. Numerous Model Y owners have reported similar complaints in forums and online communities, suggesting this may be a widespread issue. Tesla service centers have been unable to provide a consistent or effective fix for the problem.

This vehicle lacks a dedicated rain sensor and instead uses the forward-facing camera and neural net to detect moisture. In light rain, the system often fails to activate. More critically, it frequently triggers false wipes during dry conditions—sometimes multiple times per day.  Each dry swipe smears debris (e.g., bugs, sap), reducing visibility and risking permanent windshield scratches. This directly compromises driver safety and optics for the FSD/autopilot system.  Tesla has acknowledged the issue but suggests turning off automatic wipers. However, this isn’t possible when FSD or Autopilot is active—they re-enable automatically.  Proposed solution: If a wipe is triggered, the system should first activate the windshield washer. This would prevent dry swipes and maintain camera and driver visibility.  The current logic is overly aggressive and lacks basic safeguards. Tesla must revise this behavior—both for user safety and hardware longevity."

I discovered that the hazard flasher button on my 2025 Tesla Model X did not work at all. Since I could not activate the hazard lights, I had to continue driving to find another parking spot.  This was the first time I tried to use the hazard flashers since purchasing the vehicle two weeks earlier, and they have never worked. I attempted both a power cycle and vehicle reset, but the hazard button remains completely unresponsive. On this model, the hazard flasher is integrated into a touch-sensitive bar in the center console, and there is no alternative physical or touchscreen backup control.  The absence of functioning hazard lights poses a significant safety risk. If I only discovered this defect during a true emergency situation (e.g., breakdown or accident), I would not have been able to warn surrounding traffic.

On June 9, 2025, the dealership replaced the front bumper with an OEM part.

I was ready to park my vehicle in the garage of my company with very low speed between two vehicles, then it suddenly accelerated on its own and the brakes would not stop the vehicle. My vehicle collided with a wall only around 3 feet before my vehicle. I have concern that this incident resulted from a defect with my vehicle, so I noticed Toyota's dealer and Toyota. I suspect this is a control system failure since this is a new hybrid vehicle. I have heard online that there are several accidents happened for Toyota hybrid vehicles having similar experience: new vehicles with low speed even with foot on the brake. The unintended acceleration under low speed with foot on the brake is a safety issue. However, Toyota did not think this is a vehicle defect after its around two month's investigation."

We were forced to exit the highway immediately (we were less than 0.5 miles to an exit). Shortly after pulling onto the off-ramp, the vehicle entered limp mode, significantly limiting its ability to function - all assist systems deactivated amd the car has a significant decrease in power. We were able to drive approximately half a mile to a nearby gas station, where we called for a tow. This situation left us vulnerable on a busy roadway, placing both us and other drivers at risk. The Toyota dealership diagnosed the issue as damage to the hybrid inverter radiator, allegedly caused by a rock or piece of debris entering through the front grille. We were told this was not covered under warranty, and to make matters worse, the necessary part is currently on backorder for three weeks to three months—leaving the vehicle undriveable. A significant concern is the design of the front grille, which has large, open gaps that allow ordinary road debris to enter the engine compartment. This leaves critical components like the hybrid inverter radiator exposed and vulnerable, even under standard driving conditions. After researching, I discovered numerous similar reports from other Toyota hybrid owners—including those with Grand Highlanders, Highlander Hybrids, RAV4 Hybrids, and Prius models—who have experienced the exact same issue.

I went to the dealership multiple times with this complaint and they claim it is normal operation. I did not hear the same issue in the cars they compared mine to, but after Toyota's refusal to address the issue i looked it up and there are other reports  [XXX] ). When at the dealership, I am continually faced with dismissive responses from the service departments and technicians, who have failed to address the underlying cause of the sound.  This sound creates a serious distraction while driving and has caused physical symptoms including headaches, nausea, ear discomfort, and dizziness. These symptoms impair my ability to concentrate and safely operate the vehicle. On longer drives, the effects intensify, increasing the risk of driver fatigue, disorientation, or even potential loss of control. I believe this presents a significant safety hazard, not only due to the physical impact on the driver, but also because it undermines focus and reaction time, especially in high-traffic or high-speed conditions. This issue should be investigated for potential defects in the HVAC design, acoustic insulation, or related components.

During mid afternoon the sun hits on the gloss panels and reflects into the eye of the driver blinding them. Because of the angle, it is even blinding wearing sun glasses because it reflects under the glasses. During this time of day it is extremely difficult to see because of the gloss panel and could cause an accident. The only way to prevent the glare is by covering the entire console with a towel or other material. They make this panel in a matte finish, however, for some reason some models have the high gloss. The high gloss is VERY unsafe."

The incident happened on June, 7, 2025. i was driving on i81 northbound near exit 228 Verona city, Augusta County. i was in the left lane and my speed was 70 mph and approaching a bridge suddenly a SUV from right lane comes into my lane and hit my truck from right and then comes in front of my truck makes a direct front impact. i was shocked by this impact and trying to keep my truck in my lane but my all my truck safety features are stop working and lane departure features fails and my truck going into one direction only i was trying to keep the truck in left lane but the truck only goes to right side and due to this my truck hits the bridge guardrail and then get off from the bridge into the water. there is a clear failure of the lane departure feature failure because the truck was out of control and controlling itself. secondly the airbags on my truck didn't deploy even i had direct 3-4 impacts. For the result of these failures i was seriously injured and have life threatening injuries.I want to submit this because i want to help others as well.  i am out of work right now no one here to help me. i need some help or compensation from Volvo."

After being aware of the very sensitive sensor, I made sure my feet are not anywhere near the bumper, but l am still experiencing the same problem when I am standing near the rear bumper for any length of time loading items into the rear storage area.  The owner’s manual describes a beeping sound emits when the rear hatch is opened and closed when using the swiping method under the rear bumper with a leg.  I did not hear any warning sound and now that I am aware of this warning method, I listen for it and still do not hear the sound.  I have taken the vehicle to the dealer for an inspection.  While there they activated the rear hatch in my presence with the swiping motion and said that they could hear a faint beep sound which they explained is the same on all Volvo SUV’s.  They demonstrated the swiping method on another SUV while I was there.  Again, I did not hear the warning sound, but they were able to hear the faint sound.  I was informed by the service advisor that there was no remedy to make the warning sound louder.  It should be noted that the approximate date listed is the last time it occurred.

The vehicle’s Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is [XXX] .  Since taking delivery, I have encountered multiple persistent problems that have severely impacted the vehicle’s functionality and my overall driving experience. These issues include: Car Sensors: The sensors frequently malfunction, leading to inconvenience and raising serious safety concerns.  Heads-Up Display: The display intermittently shuts off, limiting access to critical driving information.  Cruise Control: This feature is entirely non-functional, significantly detracting from the driving experience.  Sound System: Following a recent service visit, the audio system has completely stopped working, with no sound from the music system, indicators, or system alerts.  Check Engine Light: The malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) repeatedly illuminates, suggesting potential issues with the engine or related systems, likely triggered by sensor malfunctions. This persistent warning heightens my concerns about the vehicle’s safety and reliability.  Despite multiple visits to your service center—exceeding ten occasions—these issues remain unresolved. The service team has typically reset error messages or updated the software, only for the problems to reoccur shortly thereafter. Most recently, the sound system failure emerged post-service, further compounding my frustration with this brand-new vehicle.

The issue is most noticeable during daytime when light hits the glass at an angle, or at night when headlights from other vehicles shine through the rear windows. The affected glass appears to have a bluish or foggy tint that creates a distorted or “cold” appearance, reducing rearward visibility.  This appears to be a defect with the window glass itself—possibly related to factory tinting, lamination, or an optical coating. The windows are original and available for inspection upon request.  Safety Risk:  This visual distortion significantly impairs rear visibility, especially when relying on mirrors at night or during lane changes. It compromises safe operation of the vehicle by creating unclear visual cues. Passengers and other road users are at risk due to reduced driver awareness of approaching vehicles or obstacles.  Dealer Confirmation:  I have not yet received formal acknowledgment or confirmation from the dealership, but I plan to raise the issue at my next service appointment. Online forums and other owner reports suggest this is a known issue affecting multiple recent Volvo models.  Inspection:  The vehicle has not yet been inspected for this issue by Volvo, police, or insurance representatives. I am willing to make the vehicle available for inspection.  Warning Messages:  There were no warning lamps or dashboard alerts associated with this issue.

I’ve been having a number of software glitches since then, but the last incident put my life in direct danger. Yesterday, [XXX] I was driving [XXX] on [XXX]  (a four-lane motorway) in Aventura with around 55MPH speed and 76% battery charge. While driving the steering wheel display went dark and at that point, I had no information about my speed or vehicle status typically displayed on the screen. Shortly after that outage the larger Volvo screen started to flicker and went dark. At that point I started to lose control and longer able to safely operate the vehicle. Approximately 30 seconds after the larger screen went dark the turning signals stopped working and I was exposed to a direct rear-end impact from oncoming vehicles. Finally, the vehicle itself lost power and I slowed down almost to a complete stop in the middle of the road while bracing for a direct impact. By grace of God, I was somehow able to use the vehicle inertia and pull over to the side of the road and call for help using my cellphone. The vehicle regained power without any intervention roughly about 10 minutes after that incident. After the smaller screen came back online it displayed a number of error messages including “Critical suspension fault. Stop safely”, “Parking brake cannot hold the car” and others. The vehicle is currently at the dealer awaiting inspection. My fear is that similar software outages could happen to others and they may not be as lucky as I was. If this incident would have happened on the highway at higher speed the outcome would have been fatal. My best guess is that the software updated while the vehicle was in motion and took out of operation all components - powertrain, steering, brakes, even the SOS call button.  Please investigate and consider stop sale order, this truly was a close call and I simply got lucky.  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)"

The issue occurred when the house batteries were below 100% charge, the engine was at idle or low RPM (below 1,250), and the secondary alternator began charging the Lithionics battery system, causing RPMs to drop below 500, complete loss of propulsion (unable to move forward or reverse), and occasional activation of the check engine light with codes P0506, P3002E6, and P30059B. This happened four times, including twice when attempting to pull out from stops, which could have resulted in a collision if traffic had been present—imagine suddenly stalling in an intersection with family aboard. The problem resolved at lower elevations (below 2,000 feet) or when maintaining higher RPMs before charging initiated, but it was reproducible every time the conditions were met at altitude. Despite diagnostics at a Mercedes-Benz dealership , where systems were cleared and no faults found (suspecting the Winnebago-installed secondary alternator), and repairs at the Winnebago Factory Service Center in Forest City, IA , where the Wakespeed regulator was unnecessarily replaced and the issue blamed on Mercedes (suggesting an unsubstantiated ""learning mode"" at elevation), the root cause remains unaddressed. This defect, reported by multiple other Ekko owners in online forums and directly to Winnebago, violates Mercedes upfitting guidelines against drawing alternator power below 1,200 RPM and poses an ongoing risk of sudden power loss in traffic or on highways.
