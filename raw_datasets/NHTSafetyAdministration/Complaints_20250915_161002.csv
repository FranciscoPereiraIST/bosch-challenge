This situation posed a serious safety risk — had the remaining nuts failed while driving, the wheel could have detached entirely, potentially leading to a crash or injury. I noticed the issue during a basic inspection many miles after the pickup. I was forced to buy and install a replacement lug nut myself to make the vehicle roadworthy and safe to drive.

The issue was confirmed independently by me, and I informed the rental company immediately. They acknowledged the problem and promised to refund the cost of the part.

NHTSA’s own inquiry into these behaviors, and Tesla’s desire to keep responses confidential, underscore the importance of fully transparent oversight   What I respectfully request: Confirm whether Tesla submitted its full responses by the deadline   Ensure that all communications are reviewed under applicable standards, not withheld as proprietary.
